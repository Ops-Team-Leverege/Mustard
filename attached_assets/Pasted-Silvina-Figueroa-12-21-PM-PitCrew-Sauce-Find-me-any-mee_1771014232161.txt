Got it, @Silvina Figueroa — checking now...
[12:21 PM]The meeting on December 9, 2025, discussed camera placement. Chris Corwin mentioned the difficulty of moving a hardwired camera at store 42 and explored options for adjusting its vertical angle.
"I don't know if I'm going to be able to move 42, that final camera. Um at least in the initial phase, just because that one it's hardwired at that point." — Chris Corwin

Happy to help, @Silvina Figueroa...
[12:22 PM]For Discount Tire & Service Center (DTSC), camera placement adjustments have been discussed, focusing on optimizing views for specific bays. Corey Chang noted that while DTSC attempted angle adjustments, they did not move any cameras from their installed positions, leading to visibility issues in certain bays.

Why This Answer:
The discussion about camera placement at DTSC highlights the challenges in ensuring optimal coverage of service bays. Adjustments were made to camera angles, but without repositioning the cameras, some bays remain inadequately covered. This affects the accuracy of service tracking, as certain bays are obstructed when cars are on adjacent lifts.

Key Details:
- Corey Chang analyzed the current camera setup at DTSC's store 42, identifying that bays 2, 3, 6, and 7 have visibility issues.
- Specifically, bays 3, 6, and 7 are completely blocked when cars are on adjacent lifts, impacting service tracking accuracy.
- DTSC made angle adjustments but did not relocate cameras, which limits the effectiveness of these changes.

General Context:
In general, camera placement is critical for accurate service tracking in automotive service centers. Adjustments often involve both angle changes and physical repositioning to ensure all service areas are visible and effectively monitored.
