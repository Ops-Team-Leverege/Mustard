✅ GOOD CHANGES (Aligned with Architecture)
1. LLM-first contract selection (43c392a)

What: Added proposedContracts field to IntentClassificationResult and prioritizes LLM-proposed contracts over keyword matching
Why it's good: Aligns with the "LLM-first architecture" principle. The LLM understands semantic intent better than regex patterns
Architecture fit: ✅ Extends semantic extraction to include contract selection, not just intent classification
Concern: ⚠️ There's already proposedInterpretation.contracts - now we have TWO places for contracts (proposedContracts and proposedInterpretation.contracts). This creates redundancy.
2. Action item keyword expansion (c13f56b)

What: Added typo variations ("actions items", "action item", "followup", etc.)
Why it's good: Improves user experience by handling common typos
Architecture fit: ✅ Enhances existing keyword fast-path without changing architecture
Concern: None - this is a reasonable enhancement
⚠️ QUESTIONABLE CHANGES (Potential Hot Fixes)
3. Fuzzy company matching - CONTAINS variant (ae1d374)

What: Added LIKE '%' || LOWER($1) || '%' (contains match) after prefix match
Why it's questionable:
This is very broad - "ACE" would match "Palace Hardware" or "Surface Pro"
Could cause false positives
Feels like a hot fix to compensate for LLM extraction issues
Architecture fit: ⚠️ Adds complexity to compensate for upstream issues
Better solution: Fix the LLM prompt to extract full company names, or use a proper fuzzy matching library
4. Debug logging spam (937f14c, 021afdf, 242b436)

What: Added multiple debug logs for company extraction
Why it's questionable:
Debugging logs should be temporary, not committed
Adds noise to production logs
Indicates they were debugging the company extraction issue
Architecture fit: ❌ Debug code shouldn't be in production
Better solution: Use proper logging levels (DEBUG vs INFO) and remove after debugging
🔴 ARCHITECTURAL CONCERNS
Duplicate contract fields:

export type IntentClassificationResult = {
  proposedInterpretation?: ProposedInterpretation;  // Has .contracts field
  proposedContracts?: string[];                     // NEW - duplicate!
}
This violates Single Source of Truth principle. Now we have:

intentResult.proposedContracts (new)
intentResult.proposedInterpretation?.contracts (existing)
The Decision Layer tries to use both:

const llmProposedContracts = intentResult.proposedContracts || intentResult.proposedInterpretation?.contracts;
Recommendation: Remove proposedContracts and always use proposedInterpretation.contracts for consistency.

Summary
Change	Type	Verdict
LLM-first contract selection	Architecture	✅ Good intent, ⚠️ creates redundancy
Action item keywords	Enhancement	✅ Good
CONTAINS fuzzy match	Hot fix	⚠️ Too broad, potential false positives
Debug logging	Debug code	❌ Should be removed
Overall Assessment: Mix of good architectural improvements and hot fixes. The main concern is the duplicate contract fields and overly broad
