Notable Gap in Set 3:
"Do you use my data to train AI models?" — This question exists on the current site but is not included in Set 3. The current site answers this directly and positively. If you use Set 3, consider adding this back or explicitly noting it's being removed.

Summary:
~16 questions are NEW in Set 3. This set is the most polished for web publishing, with clean category headers and concise answers. However, it drops the AI training FAQ that's currently live. All three sets dramatically expand coverage from the current 5 camera/privacy FAQs to include value propositions, integrations, and roadmap transparency.
