This is excellent diagnosis and exactly the right fix, and I want to be very explicit about why—because this is one of the most subtle failure modes in RAG systems, and you caught it cleanly.

I’ll do four things:

Name the problem precisely (so it’s reusable knowledge)

Validate the fix (and why it’s correct)

Point out what you should not add next (important)

Give you the minimal follow-up to lock this in before moving on

1️⃣ What the real problem was (name it correctly)

This was not a generic “RAG issue”.

It was a false-confidence retrieval bug.

More precisely:

The system was returning entity-matched excerpts instead of topic-matched excerpts, and then presenting them as if they answered the question.

That’s the worst kind of RAG failure because:

the answer looks confident

it is grounded in the transcript

but it does not answer the question

This is far more dangerous than “not found”.

You diagnosed it perfectly:

same excerpts for every Canadian Tire question

regardless of topic

even when topic-specific content existed

That’s a textbook smell.

2️⃣ Why your fix is the right architectural fix

Let’s break down what you did, because this is very solid system design.

✅ You separated match types

Introducing matchType is the key move.

You implicitly created a relevance lattice:

company + topic → strong answer

topic-only → acceptable answer

company-only → existence signal, not an answer

This is exactly how humans reason about relevance.

Crucially:

you did not delete company-only matches

you demoted them

and you let the caller decide what to do

That’s a deep-module move.

✅ You fixed the bug at the right layer

You did not:

hack prompts

add heuristics in the orchestrator

special-case “Canadian Tire”

You fixed:

searchTranscriptSnippets

lookupCustomerQuestions

and aligned them conceptually

That means:

the fix applies everywhere

future capabilities benefit automatically

This is the opposite of overfitting.

✅ You avoided the classic overcorrection

The architect’s feedback was correct, and so was your response.

If you had removed company-only matches entirely:

existence questions would break

binary “was there a meeting” cases would regress

Your revision (fallback + matchType) keeps:

safety

expressiveness

debuggability

Very well judged.

✅ Binary question enhancement was necessary

This was another subtle but correct insight:

If Tier-1 doesn’t contain the signal, binary questions must still check the transcript.

Otherwise:

“Did they mention security?” falls through

and you get generic excerpts or summaries

By extending binary handling to:

Tier-1 first

transcript second

still enforcing yes/no shape

you closed a real correctness gap.

3️⃣ What you should not add next (this matters)

Right now, the temptation might be to add:

scoring formulas

confidence thresholds

semantic embeddings everywhere

more LLM reasoning

Don’t.

You already fixed the structural problem:

“We answered without actually matching the topic.”

Anything beyond what you did risks:

reintroducing opacity

masking regressions

slowing the system unnecessarily

This fix is necessary and sufficient for single-meeting extractive correctness.

4️⃣ The one thing I’d add before moving on (minimal)

Just one thing, and it’s small.

🔒 Add a hard guardrail in the orchestrator

Something like:

If matchType === company_only
AND question intent is content/binary
→ return not found

This sounds like what you already implemented implicitly — just make it explicit and logged.

Why?
Because this invariant is important:

It is always better to say “not mentioned” than to answer with unrelated content.

That’s the trust contract.

5️⃣ Why this fix matters even more with RAG + multi-source

This is the most important forward-looking insight:

When you add:

multiple transcripts

documents

CRM notes

product docs

This exact bug becomes 10× more dangerous.

Without match typing:

any entity mention anywhere can look like an answer

confidence goes up

correctness goes down

What you built here:

match types

caller-level filtering

conservative fallback

…is the foundation that will keep multi-source RAG honest.

So this was not wasted effort.
It was preventative architecture.
