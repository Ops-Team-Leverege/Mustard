Updated Response for Replit

Document Output Feature - Final Spec
Let's keep this simple for v1:
What to Build

Generate .docx for these contracts:

VALUE_PROPOSITION
MEETING_SUMMARY
COMPARISON
DRAFT_EMAIL
PATTERN_ANALYSIS
Also any response > 300 words


Clean formatting - headings + bullets, no fancy templates. One Leverege-branded base template.
Upload to Slack with a friendly message:

📄 ACE_Value_Proposition_2026-01-27.docx

Here's your value proposition doc — ready to edit and make it your own. 
Can I help with anything else?

Message varies slightly by type:

Meeting summary → "ready to share or add your notes"
Email draft → "ready to copy and personalize"
Comparison → "ready to share with the team"



What NOT to Build (for now)

❌ Pre-generation questions (skip the state management complexity)
❌ Smart context detection
❌ Document versioning
❌ Customer-specific templates

⚠️ Important: No Hardcoding
To avoid adding technical debt, please externalize to config files:
DataConfig LocationContracts that trigger docsconfig/documents.jsonWord threshold (300)config/documents.jsonMessage templates by typeconfig/documents.jsonFile naming patternconfig/documents.json
Example config/documents.json:
json{
  "generateDocForContracts": [
    "VALUE_PROPOSITION",
    "MEETING_SUMMARY",
    "COMPARISON", 
    "DRAFT_EMAIL",
    "PATTERN_ANALYSIS"
  ],
  "wordThreshold": 300,
  "fileNamePattern": "{customer}_{type}_{date}.docx",
  "messages": {
    "VALUE_PROPOSITION": "Here's your value proposition doc — ready to edit and make it your own.",
    "MEETING_SUMMARY": "Here's your meeting summary — ready to share or add your notes.",
    "DRAFT_EMAIL": "Here's your email draft — ready to copy and personalize.",
    "default": "Here's your document — ready to edit and share."
  },
  "closing": "Can I help with anything else?"
}
This way we can tune behavior without code deploys.
Why Keep It Simple
Users haven't seen doc output yet. Ship the basic version, see what they actually need, then iterate. Don't build features for problems that don't exist.
