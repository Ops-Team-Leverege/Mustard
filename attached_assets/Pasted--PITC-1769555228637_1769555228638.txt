================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

✅ WHAT'S WORKING WELL:

1. PRODUCT_EXPLANATION responses are excellent
   - "How does PitCrew work?" → Detailed, accurate product explanation
   - Properly uses ambient knowledge without overclaiming

2. NEXT_STEPS extraction is accurate
   - "What were the action items from ACE?" → Correctly extracts action items
   - Includes speaker attribution and dates

3. REFUSE is working for out-of-scope
   - "Write me a poem about tires" → Properly refuses
   - "What's Eric's salary?" → Properly refuses

4. Contract selection is now diverse
   - 17 different contract types used (was 100% GENERAL_RESPONSE before)


⚠️ MAIN ISSUE: Over-Clarifying

The system is asking for clarification even when it has enough context to execute:

| Question | Contract Selected | Actual Response |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| "Tell me about the dashboard conversation" | MEETING_SUMMARY | "I need more context..." |
| "What'd they say about the cameras?" | EXTRACTIVE_FACT | "I need more context..." |
| "Get me the feedback from our big accounts" | CUSTOMER_QUESTIONS | "I need more context..." |

ROOT CAUSE: The contract is being selected correctly, but the execution
is still falling back to clarification instead of searching the data.


================================================================================
RESPONSE EXAMPLES BY QUALITY
================================================================================

### EXCELLENT: Evidence-Based Answers

Q: "What were the action items from ACE?"
Contract: NEXT_STEPS
Response: *Next Steps — Atlantic Coast Enterprise (ACE - Jiffy Lube) (Jan 23, 2026)*
• Schedule a follow-up call next Friday to review progress...
• Investigate and resolve the screen saver issue on the TV at location 1739...
✅ Correctly extracts action items with attribution


Q: "How does PitCrew work?"  
Contract: PRODUCT_EXPLANATION
Response: At a high level, PitCrew is a B2B SaaS product from Leverege used by 
automotive service businesses to gain visibility into shop operations...
✅ Clear, accurate product explanation


### GOOD: Reasonable Responses

Q: "Does PitCrew integrate with POS?"
Contract: FEATURE_VERIFICATION
Response: I don't have authoritative product data here to confirm specific 
POS integrations. For definitive details, please check our product documentation...
✅ Appropriately cautious when SSOT not available


### APPROPRIATE CLARIFY

Q: "You know what I mean"
Contract: CLARIFY
Response: I need a bit more context to help you effectively...
✅ Correctly asks for clarification on vague query


### NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

Q: "Tell me about the dashboard conversation"
Contract: MEETING_SUMMARY (correct!)
Response: I need a bit more context to help you effectively...
❌ Should search meetings for dashboard discussions


================================================================================
SPECIFIC ISSUES TO FIX
================================================================================

1. CONTRACT EXECUTION NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH
   - Contract is selected correctly (MEETING_SUMMARY, EXTRACTIVE_FACT)
   - But execution still returns "I need more context"
   - Need to check contract executor is actually searching data

2. ENTITY RESOLUTION FOR AMBIGUOUS QUERIES
   - "Tell me about the dashboard conversation" → No meeting resolved
   - System should search across meetings for "dashboard" mentions
   - Currently only works when explicit company/meeting name given

3. CLARIFY MESSAGE CUSTOMIZATION
   - All clarify responses are identical: "I need a bit more context..."
   - The LLM Interpretation module should provide specific clarifying questions
   - e.g., "Which meeting - Les Schwab or ACE?"

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. FIX CONTRACT EXECUTION
   - Verify executor actually queries meeting data when contract is MEETING_SUMMARY
   - Add logging to see why execution returns clarify instead of data

2. IMPROVE ENTITY RESOLUTION
   - When no explicit meeting/company, search across all meetings
   - Use topic keywords ("dashboard", "pricing") to find relevant meetings

3. CUSTOMIZE CLARIFY MESSAGES  
   - Use LLM interpretation's clarifyMessage instead of generic response
   - Offer specific options: "Did you mean Les Schwab or ACE meeting?"

4. ADD MULTI-MEETING SEARCH
   - "What'd they say about cameras?" should search all meetings
   - Return aggregated results with source attribution
