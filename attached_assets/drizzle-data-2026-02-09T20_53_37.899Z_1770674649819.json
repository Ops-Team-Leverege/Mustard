Currently, the recommended pilot duration is structured as follows:\n- A **45-day free pilot** for one store, which includes a **15-day baseline data collection period** followed by **30 days of testing**.\n- After the initial 45 days, customers have options to either stop, sign a subscription, or extend the pilot for an additional **45 days for $500**, making a total potential pilot duration of **90 days**.\n\nEric mentioned in a message that \"on sales calls, I think we should say that our pilots are 60 days, rather than saying '60-90'.\" This suggests a preference for a more concise pilot length to facilitate quicker decisions and payments.\n\nAdditionally, a message from the contracts collaboration channel noted that \"our standard free pilot length was 60 days when ACE signed, though we agreed to extend it to 90 days. Now the standard length is 45 for the free portion.\"\n\nIn summary, the recommended pilot length for Pomps is currently **45 days**, with the possibility to extend it to **90 days** if needed.\n\n### Relevant Sources:\n1.

They want to expand to 10 stores, and use this to more closely evaluate the ROI of PitCrew before deciding whether they deploy to the rest of their footprint (about 75 total stores). For this 10 store expansion, it'll be critical that we are aligned on which metrics we are evaluating, so that we can have an objective measure of success. I want to create a draft plan for expansion which includes (a) which key metrics we'll be evaluating, (b) how we'll measure/evaluate them, and (c) what % improvement we're targeting for each metric. I do not have confidence in the customer creating this themselves, so I believe we need to create a draft and have them react to it.\n\nCreate a document that details success measures for this 10 store expansion. Here is what I'm thinking:\n• One of the metrics is customer satisfaction. They already measure this via surveys that customers take. To measure this, we would compare the same calendar period from the year prior (to reduce extraneous variables like seasonality). Happier customers should lead to more business over time, i.e. more repeat customers, though we won't be able to prove that necessarily during this expansion\n    ◦ Let's target a 1% improvement (e.g. if their overall satisfaction score was 65%, we bump it to 66%)\n• The other metric is average service duration. This will ultimately translate into one or both of the following: (1) more revenue, because during periods of high demand more invoices can be completed with the same team meaning more money, and you lose fewer customers to abandonments from too long wait times, and (2) labor cost savings, because you can accomplish the same number of invoices with a smaller team\n    ◦ Measuring this is a bit more tricky, since Ivy Lane doesn't have any pre-existing data for comparison. So I think that for each store, the first 2 weeks after we install PitCrew, we collect a baseline of data. Then we install the TV dashboards in the bays and give access to the store managers. That way we can compare the average service duration before and after\n    ◦ Let's target a 10% improvement (e.g. if the average service duration is 20 minutes, we improve by 2 minutes)\n• For each metric, explain:\n    ◦ Why it matters / the business value (lean on the value props of PitCrew here to inform your writing)\n    ◦ How we will measure it plus why we recommend this methodology\n    ◦ The target goal\n• Let's place the total evaluation timeline, for each store, at minimum 60 days, starting from when PitCrew is first installed. 15 days of baseline collection then 45 days of comparison for improvement\n    ◦ We should also include a draft roll out schedule. Assume 10 total stores. They already have 2 deployed, so 8 new deployments. Let's assume 4 the first month and 4 the second month. Assume it takes 15 days to ship server, and do set up and configuration before we're ready to start collecting baseline. So each store is total of ~90 days. Given 4 stores won't be deployed til the second month, that means that this whole thing would run for about 120 days aka  months\n• In addition, one concern that the customer has voiced is that the roll out of the pilot stores took a lot of time/effort from one of their key people to support, so they're concerned about the maintenance burden of rolling out additional stores. As such, it's important that we mention this explicitly and how we plan to mitigate the burden on them. I'm not sure how we would measure this. Maybe we add another success criterion that's: by the 10th store, PitCrew installation can be performed entirely by the on-site crew with no on-site travel required from Kou (the key person mentioned) or from Leverege.\n    ◦ We should also cover the process for rolling out a new store. Basically we ship them a server, someone onsite plugs it into their NVR via ethernet, then once we access the local cameras we give feedback on adjustments to camera angles. They also physically install at least one TV in the bay in a place where everyone can see it.\nBefore you attempt, do you have any questions? Also tell me how you think this should be structured, before you create the document, so I can give you early feedback before you do the work","answer_text":"Certainly!

This extended duration allows for thorough testing of the technology in a setting that has different requirements compared to standard retail operations.\n\n**Key Details:**\n- The standard pilot length for most clients is 45 days, as indicated in a message from Calum on December 10, 2025, which reflects a shift from a previous 60-day pilot to encourage quicker transitions to paid services [Message 14].\n- Pomps is being offered a 90-day pilot to accommodate the unique challenges of their business model, which involves commercial tire services that require more extensive data collection and testing [Message 12].\n\n**General Context:**\nThe adjustment to a 90-day pilot for Pomps is a strategic decision to ensure that the technology can be effectively evaluated in their specific operational context.

By shortening the free pilot period and emphasizing the need for a decision sooner, the company aims to enhance cash flow and customer commitment.
