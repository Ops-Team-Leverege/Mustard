Eliminate Duplicate Intent & Contract Authority
Context

We are hardening the existing PitCrew Control Plane. Intent classification, scope resolution, and contract chain selection are already implemented and stable in server/controlPlane. Single-meeting and multi-meeting behavior must remain unchanged.

Change

Remove all duplicate intent classification and contract selection logic outside the Control Plane. Enforce the Control Plane as the sole authority for intent and contract decisions.

Constraints (Must Not Change)

This change must not:

Alter Control Plane intent classification behavior

Alter contract constraints or failure semantics

Introduce new intents or contracts

Add new LLM calls

Change execution results for valid requests

Implementation Notes
1. Remove Open Assistant Intent Classification

Delete or bypass server/openAssistant/intentClassifier.ts

Remove any calls to Open Assistant–level intent classification

Do not perform intent classification in openAssistantHandler.ts

2. Use Control Plane Intent Exclusively

openAssistantHandler.ts must consume intent only from the Control Plane result

Remove mapControlPlaneToEvidenceSource()–style bridging logic

No “fake” or reconstructed intent objects

3. Remove Orchestrator-Level Intent Logic

Delete intent classification logic in singleMeetingOrchestrator.ts

Remove SingleMeetingIntent types (extractive | aggregative | summary)

Remove mapOrchestratorIntentToContract()

Orchestrator must:

receive a ContractChain from the Control Plane

execute it verbatim

never select or override contracts

4. Enforce Single Source of Truth

Intent is classified once, in server/controlPlane/intent.ts

Contract chains are selected once, in answerContracts.ts

Execution layers must not reinterpret intent or contracts

Acceptance Criteria

Only one intent classifier exists in the system (Control Plane)

No LLM calls perform intent or contract selection outside the Control Plane

Orchestrators execute contracts without reclassification

No behavior regression in existing single- or multi-meeting flows

Logs clearly show Control Plane intent and contract chain used
