The Ambient Product Context is NOT being applied. The model doesn't know it's PitCrew.

Key Problems Identified
1. 🔴 Ambient Product Context NOT Working
23 out of 122 responses asked "which PitCrew do you mean?"
Examples:

"I'm not sure which 'PitCrew' you're referring to..."
"Could you clarify which 'PitCrew' you mean?"
"There are several products with that name..."

This should NEVER happen. The Ambient Prompt should establish:

"You are assisting with PitCrew, a product by Leverege."

Root Cause: The Ambient Product Context prompt is either:

Not being injected into the system prompt
Being overridden by Open Assistant's default behavior
Not reaching the LLM at all


2. 🔴 PRODUCT_KNOWLEDGE Intent Never Used
Expected IntentActual IntentCountPRODUCT_KNOWLEDGEGENERAL_HELP31/31
Every single product question went to GENERAL_HELP instead of PRODUCT_KNOWLEDGE.
Examples:

"How is PitCrew priced?" → GENERAL_HELP (should be PRODUCT_KNOWLEDGE)
"Does PitCrew integrate with POS systems?" → GENERAL_HELP (should be PRODUCT_KNOWLEDGE)
"What safety features does PitCrew provide?" → GENERAL_HELP (should be PRODUCT_KNOWLEDGE)


3. 🟡 Meeting Intents Partially Working
Some meeting questions are now routing correctly:
IntentCountNotesSINGLE_MEETING8✅ Direct hitscontent8✅ Sub-intent workingsummary3✅ Sub-intent workingnext_steps3✅ Sub-intent workingattendees2✅ Sub-intent workingprep3✅ Sub-intent workingTotal meeting-related2722% of total
But 65%+ of meeting questions still go to GENERAL_HELP.

4. 🔴 Evidence Context NEVER Used
Evidence Context used: 0/122 (0.0%)
Ambient Only: 122/122 (100.0%)
Even when intent is correctly classified as SINGLE_MEETING, the meeting transcript is not being loaded.

5. 🔴 Answer Contract Always GENERAL_RESPONSE
GENERAL_RESPONSE: 122/122 (100%)
No contract variation. The system is not selecting contracts based on intent.

What's Working vs What's Broken
✅ Working (Partial)

Some meeting questions route to meeting-related intents
Pattern matching for known companies (Les Schwab, ACE) sometimes works
Test runner executes and logs correctly

❌ Broken

PRODUCT_KNOWLEDGE intent - Never triggered (0%)
