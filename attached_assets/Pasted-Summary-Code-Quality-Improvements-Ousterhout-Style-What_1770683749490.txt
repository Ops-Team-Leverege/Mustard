Summary: Code Quality Improvements (Ousterhout-Style)
What We Accomplished
Phase 1: Critical Fixes ✅

Consolidated duplicate MEETING_WORDS constant (was in 2 files)
Centralized production-tunable values (timeouts, rate limits, session TTL)
Added null safety check in semanticAnswerSingleMeeting.ts
Removed unused test utilities from production code
Phase 2: Maintainability Focus ✅

Fixed misleading @deprecated comment (it wasn't deprecated, just internal)
Created ERROR_HANDLING.md documenting existing patterns
Added missing timeout constants (with Replit Agent's help)
Key Decisions (Following Ousterhout)
What We Did:

✅ Centralized values used in multiple places
✅ Centralized values that need production tuning
✅ Documented existing patterns instead of creating new frameworks
✅ Fixed misleading comments
What We Avoided (No Over-Engineering):

❌ Didn't create constants for every number
❌ Didn't create custom error classes
❌ Didn't add try-catch everywhere
❌ Didn't create logging frameworks
❌ Didn't move script-specific batch sizes to constants

The codebase is now more maintainable without being over-engineered. All changes follow the principle: make the code easier to understand and modify, not just "cleaner" by some abstract standard.
