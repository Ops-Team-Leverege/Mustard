Write a complete executive summary that covers:
- Why this document exists (purpose and context)
- The approach you're recommending (methodology)
- What outcomes to expect (key results and recommendations)

**2. Main Content Sections** (Numbered with ##)
Write detailed sections covering each major topic:
- Use numbered sections (## 1. First Topic, ## 2. Second Topic)
- Include subsections (### 1.1 Subtopic)
- For each point: Explain WHAT it is, WHY it matters, and HOW to implement
- Use tables for metrics, timelines, and comparisons
- Include specific examples and data points
- Write in full paragraphs, not bullet points

**3. Supporting Details** (Full paragraphs)
Write comprehensive explanations of:
- Methodology: How you'll measure success
- Timelines: When key milestones occur
- Assumptions: What you're assuming to be true
- Risks: What could go wrong and how to mitigate

**4. Next Steps** (Specific and actionable)
Write a detailed action plan:
- **Action Item**: [Full description of what needs to happen]
  - Owner: [Who is responsible]
  - Timeline: [When it should be done]
  - Success Criteria: [How we know it's complete]

=== FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS ===

- Use **bold** for key decisions and important metrics
- Use tables for structured data (metrics, timelines, comparisons)
- Write in full paragraphs within sections (minimum 3-4 sentences each)
- Use bullet points ONLY for lists within paragraphs, NOT as primary structure

=== TONE & STYLE ===

- Ready for C-level stakeholders and board review
