KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

✅ WHAT'S WORKING WELL:

1. MULTI-MEETING SEARCH (PATTERN_ANALYSIS)
   - 10 queries correctly routed to PATTERN_ANALYSIS
   - Successfully searching across multiple meetings
   - Example: "What promises have we made to Les Schwab?"
     → Found 3 meetings, extracted relevant commitments

2. EMAIL DRAFTING (DRAFT_EMAIL / GENERAL_RESPONSE)
   - Professional email drafts generated
   - Proper subject lines and structure
   - Example: "Write a thank you email to ACE"
     → Full professional email with proper formatting

3. EXTERNAL RESEARCH
   - 2 queries successfully triggered EXTERNAL_RESEARCH
   - Generated research reports with company data
   - Example: "What are Canadian Tire's digital transformation goals?"
     → Full research report generated

4. PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE
   - 6 queries correctly routed to PRODUCT_EXPLANATION
   - Using product SSOT when available
   - Example: "What's our positioning on security features?"
     → Detailed product positioning response

5. NO GENERIC CLARIFICATIONS
   - 0% "I need more context" responses
   - Smart clarification working (asks specific questions)


⚠️ ISSUES TO ADDRESS:

1. SINGLE MEETING CLARIFICATION (10 instances)
   Questions like "What action items came out of the ACE weekly call?"
   Response: "Which meeting are you asking about?"
   
   ISSUE: Should search for the most recent ACE meeting, not ask for clarification.
   The user mentioned "ACE" - system should find the latest ACE meeting.

2. SLOW RESPONSES
   Average: 15.9 seconds
   Max: 95 seconds (security positioning question)
   
   Queries hitting product_ssot taking 30-90+ seconds.

3. GENERAL_RESPONSE OVERUSE (16 instances)
   Some queries getting GENERAL_RESPONSE when they should get:
   - DRAFT_EMAIL for email requests
   - MEETING_PREP for prep requests


================================================================================
SPECIFIC ISSUES
================================================================================

SINGLE MEETING QUERIES ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION:
(Should find most recent meeting with that company)

| Question | Should Do |
|----------|-----------|
| "What action items came out of the ACE weekly call?" | Find latest ACE meeting → extract action items |
| "What did Brian Buch ask us to follow up on?" | Search for Brian Buch in meetings → extract |
| "What open items for tomorrow's ACE call?" | Find latest ACE meeting → prep |
| "What did we promise to deliver to ACE?" | Search ACE meetings → extract commitments |
| "What's the timeline we agreed to with Les Schwab?" | Search Les Schwab meetings → extract timeline |

ROOT CAUSE: 
- Intent is SINGLE_MEETING but no specific meeting date provided
- System asks for clarification instead of searching for most recent match
- Should default to "most recent meeting with [company]"


================================================================================
TIMING ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Average Response Time: 15.9 seconds
Max Response Time: 95 seconds
Min Response Time: 0.6 seconds

SLOWEST QUERIES:
1. 95s - "What's our positioning on security features vs dedicated security systems?"
2. 88s - "Research quick lube industry benchmarks for cycle time"
3. 66s - "I'm updating copy on our website. What are our current value props?"
4. 39s - "A customer asked if PitCrew works with their existing security cameras"
5. 34s - "Les Schwab's IT team asked about minimum bandwidth requirements"

PATTERN: Product knowledge queries with SSOT lookup are slowest.


================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. FIX SINGLE MEETING FALLBACK
   When intent is SINGLE_MEETING and company is mentioned but no date:
   → Find most recent meeting with that company
   → Don't ask for clarification

2. IMPROVE CONTRACT ROUTING
   - "Write a thank you email" → DRAFT_EMAIL (not GENERAL_RESPONSE)
   - "Prep me for meeting" → MEETING_PREP (not GENERAL_RESPONSE)

3. OPTIMIZE PRODUCT_SSOT QUERIES
   - 95 second response time is too slow
   - Investigate caching or query optimization

4. ADD MEETING_PREP CONTRACT
   - Currently falling back to GENERAL_RESPONSE or PATTERN_ANALYSIS
   - Should have dedicated contract for prep scenarios
