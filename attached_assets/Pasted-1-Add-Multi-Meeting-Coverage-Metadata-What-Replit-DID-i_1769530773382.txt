1️⃣ Add Multi-Meeting Coverage Metadata
✅ What Replit DID implement

From your description:

MultiMeetingScope includes:

totalMeetingsSearched

matchingMeetingsCount

uniqueCompaniesRepresented

Coverage metadata is logged

Coverage is available for observability/debugging

That means:

Coverage exists and is computed ✅

❌ What is still missing

Coverage metadata is not yet enforced at the answer-shaping level.

Specifically missing:

Contracts are not required to:

reference coverage when generating analytical output

qualify language based on coverage size

Nothing prevents output like:

“Customers consistently mention…”
when coverage is:
2 meetings, 1 company

Right now, coverage is:

observed

not binding

🔒 What “done” looks like

Coverage metadata must affect how confident the system is allowed to sound.

Concretely, at least one of these must be true:

Execution instructions say:

“When coverage is limited, explicitly qualify claims (e.g. ‘based on 3 meetings…’).”

Or analytical contracts enforce:

minimum coverage for unqualified language

otherwise soften phrasing automatically

So:

Aspect	Status
Coverage computed	✅ Done
Coverage logged	✅ Done
Coverage constrains language	❌ Missing
2️⃣ Add Decision-Reason Observability
✅ What Replit DID implement

You now have contract-level observability:

Evidence counts

Authority validation status

Contract execution outcomes

This is excellent, but it’s not what “decision-reason observability” meant in the Control Plane discussion.

What you have now is:

“What happened during execution”

❌ What is still missing

What’s missing is decision-time observability, i.e.:

Why this intent was chosen

Why other intents were rejected

Why this contract chain was selected

Why CLARIFY or REFUSE triggered (at routing time)

Right now your logs answer:

“What did the contract do?”

They do not answer:

“Why did the Control Plane choose this path?”

🔒 What “done” looks like

You need structured decision metadata at Control Plane boundaries, for example:

Intent classification:

matched signals

rejected intents + reasons

Scope resolution:

how many candidates found

why scope failed or succeeded

Contract planning:

why this chain was selected

why others were excluded

This must exist before execution starts.

So:

Aspect	Status
Contract execution logs	✅ Done
Decision-time reasoning	❌ Missing
Intent rejection reasons	❌ Missing
Scope-resolution reasoning	❌ Missing
Final, Straight Answer
❌ They are not fully done, but also not absent

Multi-Meeting Coverage Metadata

Implemented ✔️

Logged ✔️

Not yet enforced in output shaping ❌

Decision-Reason Observability

Execution-level ✔️

Control-Plane decision-level ❌

They are both last-mile Control Plane completeness issues, not core correctness bugs.
