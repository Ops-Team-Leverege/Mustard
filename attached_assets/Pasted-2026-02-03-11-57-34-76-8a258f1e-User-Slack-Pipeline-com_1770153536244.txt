Processing: "we have a new feature to add to the roadmap, that will detect when the net underneath the bays (primarily for oil change shops) isn't there and alert, since this is a safety hazard. The feature is called "Net Safety Alerts". Do research to understand more about oil change shops and usage of nets and why they're important, then write the description for the feature making it similar to the descriptions for other features" in channel D0A7A4R9C04 (isReply=false)
