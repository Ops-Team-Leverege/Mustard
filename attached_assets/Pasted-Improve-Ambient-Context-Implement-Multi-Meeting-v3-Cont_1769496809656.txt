Improve Ambient Context + Implement Multi-Meeting (v3)
Context

We are refining the PitCrew assistant to:

eliminate product identity ambiguity

prevent hallucinated product claims

treat MULTI_MEETING as a first-class scope, identical in structure to SINGLE_MEETING

reuse the existing intent → scope → contracts architecture

Do not introduce new abstractions.
Extend the existing system.

Part 1 — Update Ambient Product Context (Authoritative)
Goal

Strengthen product identity and framing without introducing authoritative claims.

Ambient context must:

remove all “Which PitCrew?” ambiguity

enable high-level explanations and copy

strictly respect SSOT authority boundaries

Replace the Ambient Prompt with the following text

Always include this system-level prompt in all execution paths (no exceptions):

IMPORTANT: You are an AI assistant for PitCrew employees.
There is only ONE PitCrew — the product developed by Leverege.

=== PitCrew Identity (Established Fact) ===
- PitCrew is a B2B SaaS product developed by Leverege
- It is used by automotive service businesses (e.g., tire shops, oil change centers, car washes, dealership service departments)
- When users mention “PitCrew,” they ALWAYS mean this product
- Never ask for clarification about which PitCrew

=== Framing Context (Non-Authoritative) ===
Use the following only for high-level explanation and framing:
- PitCrew focuses on helping teams understand operations in automotive service environments
- It applies AI and computer vision concepts to analyze activity in service bays
- It is commonly described in terms of visibility, operational insight, and performance improvement

Do NOT treat the above as authoritative facts or guarantees.

=== Authority Rules ===
- When authoritative product data is not provided, speak only at a high level about purpose, value, and outcomes
- Do not state or imply specific features, integrations, guarantees, pricing, or technical details unless Product SSOT data is explicitly provided AND the active contract permits authoritative claims

Enforcement

Ambient context is not evidence

Ambient context must never be cited or used to justify claims

Product SSOT remains the only source of authoritative product facts

Part 2 — Implement MULTI_MEETING as First-Class Scope
Design Principle (Must Be Preserved)

MULTI_MEETING is not special.
It differs from SINGLE_MEETING only in scope size.

Everything else (contracts, authority, logging) works the same way.

Intent Handling

Ensure the control plane classifies and emits:

MULTI_MEETING intent when the user asks:

across meetings

over time

across customers

patterns, trends, comparisons

Examples:

“What issues have customers raised about dashboards?”

“Which customers asked about POS integration?”

“What trends are we seeing across meetings?”

Scope Resolution (Control Plane)

For MULTI_MEETING:

Resolve scope as a set of meetings, not a single meeting

Scope may include:

company filters

time ranges

topic hints (e.g., “dashboard”, “pricing”)

Example scope object:

{
  "scope": {
    "type": "multi_meeting",
    "meeting_ids": ["m1", "m2", "m3"],
    "filters": {
      "company": "ACE",
      "topic": "dashboard"
    }
  }
}


No LLM inference here — deterministic resolution only.

Contracts for MULTI_MEETING

Reuse the same contract system.

Valid MULTI_MEETING contracts include (non-exhaustive):

CUSTOMER_QUESTIONS (extractive, across meetings)

MEETING_SUMMARY (aggregate summary)

PATTERN_ANALYSIS (recurring themes)

COMPARISON (differences across meetings)

TREND_SUMMARY (over time)

Contracts:

define answer shape

define SSOT mode

do not change intent

Example — MULTI_MEETING Execution

User:
“What issues have customers raised about dashboards?”

Control Plane Output:

intent = MULTI_MEETING
scope = all relevant meetings mentioning dashboards


Contract Chain:

[
  { "contract": "CUSTOMER_QUESTIONS", "ssot_mode": null },
  { "contract": "PATTERN_ANALYSIS", "ssot_mode": null }
]


Execution:

Extract dashboard-related questions across meetings

Analyze recurring issues

No product claims unless a PRODUCT_* contract is explicitly added

Logging Requirements (Mandatory)

Ensure logs include:

{
  "intent": "MULTI_MEETING",
  "scope": { ... },
  "contract_chain": [
    { "contract": "CUSTOMER_QUESTIONS", "ssot_mode": null },
    { "contract": "PATTERN_ANALYSIS", "ssot_mode": null }
  ]
}


This must work identically to SINGLE_MEETING logging.

Constraints (Do Not Violate)

Do not introduce a separate “multi-meeting system”

Do not bypass the control plane

Do not let the LLM select intent or contracts

Do not inject Product SSOT unless the contract explicitly allows it

Do not treat MULTI_MEETING as RAG-only — retrieval is an implementation detail

Acceptance Criteria

“Which PitCrew?” never appears in responses

MULTI_MEETING queries route deterministically

MULTI_MEETING uses the same contract machinery as SINGLE_MEETING

Authority rules behave identically across scopes

Logs clearly explain intent, scope, contracts, and SSOT usage
