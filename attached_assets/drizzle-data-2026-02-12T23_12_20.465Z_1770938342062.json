They want to expand to 10 stores, and use this to more closely evaluate the ROI of PitCrew before deciding whether they deploy to the rest of their footprint (about 75 total stores). For this 10 store expansion, it'll be critical that we are aligned on which metrics we are evaluating, so that we can have an objective measure of success. I want to create a draft plan for expansion which includes (a) which key metrics we'll be evaluating, (b) how we'll measure/evaluate them, and (c) what % improvement we're targeting for each metric. I do not have confidence in the customer creating this themselves, so I believe we need to create a draft and have them react to it.\n\nCreate a document that details success measures for this 10 store expansion. Here is what I'm thinking:\n• One of the metrics is customer satisfaction. They already measure this via surveys that customers take. To measure this, we would compare the same calendar period from the year prior (to reduce extraneous variables like seasonality). Happier customers should lead to more business over time, i.e. more repeat customers, though we won't be able to prove that necessarily during this expansion\n    ◦ Let's target a 1% improvement (e.g. if their overall satisfaction score was 65%, we bump it to 66%)\n• The other metric is average service duration. This will ultimately translate into one or both of the following: (1) more revenue, because during periods of high demand more invoices can be completed with the same team meaning more money, and you lose fewer customers to abandonments from too long wait times, and (2) labor cost savings, because you can accomplish the same number of invoices with a smaller team\n    ◦ Measuring this is a bit more tricky, since Ivy Lane doesn't have any pre-existing data for comparison. So I think that for each store, the first 2 weeks after we install PitCrew, we collect a baseline of data. Then we install the TV dashboards in the bays and give access to the store managers. That way we can compare the average service duration before and after\n    ◦ Let's target a 10% improvement (e.g. if the average service duration is 20 minutes, we improve by 2 minutes)\n• For each metric, explain:\n    ◦ Why it matters / the business value (lean on the value props of PitCrew here to inform your writing)\n    ◦ How we will measure it plus why we recommend this methodology\n    ◦ The target goal\n• Let's place the total evaluation timeline, for each store, at minimum 60 days, starting from when PitCrew is first installed. 15 days of baseline collection then 45 days of comparison for improvement\n    ◦ We should also include a draft roll out schedule. Assume 10 total stores. They already have 2 deployed, so 8 new deployments. Let's assume 4 the first month and 4 the second month. Assume it takes 15 days to ship server, and do set up and configuration before we're ready to start collecting baseline. So each store is total of ~90 days. Given 4 stores won't be deployed til the second month, that means that this whole thing would run for about 120 days aka  months\n• In addition, one concern that the customer has voiced is that the roll out of the pilot stores took a lot of time/effort from one of their key people to support, so they're concerned about the maintenance burden of rolling out additional stores. As such, it's important that we mention this explicitly and how we plan to mitigate the burden on them. I'm not sure how we would measure this. Maybe we add another success criterion that's: by the 10th store, PitCrew installation can be performed entirely by the on-site crew with no on-site travel required from Kou (the key person mentioned) or from Leverege.\n    ◦ We should also cover the process for rolling out a new store. Basically we ship them a server, someone onsite plugs it into their NVR via ethernet, then once we access the local cameras we give feedback on adjustments to camera angles. They also physically install at least one TV in the bay in a place where everyone can see it.\nBefore you attempt, do you have any questions?

This will ensure all your points are covered logically and clearly for Ivy Lane:\n\n**Proposed Document Structure:**\n\n---\n\n**I. Executive Summary**\n    *   Brief overview of the 10-store expansion purpose (ROI evaluation for full deployment).\n    *   Highlight the key metrics for success and PitCrew's commitment to a data-driven partnership.\n\n**II. Introduction: Ivy Lane 10-Store Expansion Objectives**\n    *   Context: Transitioning from a 2-store pilot to a 10-store expansion.\n    *   Primary Goal: Objectively evaluate PitCrew's Return on Investment (ROI) to inform a decision on a full 75-store rollout.\n    *   Emphasis on establishing clear, measurable success criteria.\n\n**III. Key Success Metrics & Evaluation Plan**\n    *   For each identified metric, we will detail:\n        *   **A. Customer Satisfaction**\n            *   **1. Why This Metric Matters (Business Value):** Connect to \"Customer Experience & Retention\" value theme, explaining how improved satisfaction drives repeat business and loyalty.\n            *   **2. Measurement Methodology:** Detail using Ivy Lane's existing survey data, comparing year-over-year same calendar periods to mitigate seasonality. Explain why this methodology is recommended.\n            *   **3. Target Goal:** State the 1% improvement target (e.g., 65% to 66%).\n        *   **B. Average Service Duration**\n            *   **1. Why This Metric Matters (Business Value):** Connect to \"Service Speed & Throughput Capacity\" and \"Unit Economics & Capacity Planning\" value themes. Explain the direct link to increased revenue (more invoices, fewer abandonments) and potential labor cost savings.\n            *   **2. Measurement Methodology:** Detail the 2-week baseline collection post-installation, followed by the comparison period after TV dashboards and manager access are provided. Explain why this methodology is necessary given the lack of pre-existing data.\n            *   **3. Target Goal:** State the 10% improvement target (e.g., 20 minutes to 18 minutes).\n        *   **C. PitCrew Installation Efficiency & Scalability**\n            *   **1. Why This Metric Matters (Business Value):** Directly address Ivy Lane's concern about the operational burden and \"maintenance burden\" raised during the pilot. Frame this as critical for scalable deployment and reducing reliance on key personnel.\n            *   **2. Measurement Methodology:** Define the qualitative success criterion: \"By the 10th store, PitCrew installation can be performed entirely by the on-site crew with no on-site travel required from Kou or from Leverege.\"\n            *   **3. Target Goal:** Achieve the specified self-sufficient installation by the 10th store.\n\n**IV. Evaluation Timeline**\n    *   Overall project duration (~120 days / 4 months).\n    *   Per-store evaluation cycle: Minimum 60 days (15 days baseline + 45 days comparison).\n\n**V. Draft Rollout Schedule (for 8 New Stores)**\n    *   Phased approach: 4 new stores in Month 1, 4 new stores in Month 2.\n    *   Detail the 15-day pre-baseline period for server shipping, setup, and configuration per store.\n    *   Illustrate how the staggered rollout leads to the overall 120-day project duration.\n\n**VI. New Store Rollout Process & Mitigation of Installation Burden**\n    *   **Detailed Rollout Process:** Step-by-step explanation of what happens for each new store (server shipment, onsite plug-in to NVR, camera angle feedback, TV dashboard installation).\n    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Explicitly address the concern about Kou's involvement. Outline how Leverege will provide documentation, remote support, and training to empower Ivy Lane's on-site crews to achieve the self-sufficiency goal, thereby significantly reducing the burden on key personnel like Kou.\n\n**VII. Conclusion & Next Steps**\n    *   Reiterate commitment to a transparent, data-driven partnership.\n    *   Propose a review meeting to discuss this draft plan and finalize the path forward.\n\n---\n\nThis structure directly incorporates all your ideas, leverages the PitCrew context for value propositions, and addresses the customer's specific concerns.\n\nDo you have any questions or feedback on this proposed structure before I proceed with drafting the full document?\n\n_Source: Generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash_","resolved_entities":null,"confidence":null,"created_at":"2026-02-12T02:07:24.004Z","entry_point":"slack","test_run":false,"intent":"GENERAL_HELP","intent_detection_method":"llm","answer_contract":"GENERAL_RESPONSE","contract_selection_method":"default","context_layers":{"product_ssot":false,"slack_search":false,"multi_meeting":false,"total_time_ms":23455,"single_meeting":false,"lastResponseType":"general_knowledge","product_identity":true,"progress_message_count":0},"resolution":{"meeting_id":null,"company_source":"extracted","meeting_source":"none"},"evidence_sources":null,"llm_usage":{"purposes":["intent_classification"],"total_calls":1}},{"id":"c5f73ab9-59e5-4108-8c46-7efd1070a390","slack_thread_id":"1770861973.506659","slack_message_ts":"1770862117.457239","slack_channel_id":"C0A80S3HJNL","user_id":"U082TV42FM0","company_id":null,"meeting_id":null,"capability_name":"GENERAL_RESPONSE","question_text":"why you didn't ask any questions?","answer_text":"You're right to call me out on that!

That way we can compare the average service duration before and after\n    ◦ Let's target a 10% improvement (e.g. if the average service duration is 20 minutes, we improve by 2 minutes)\n• For each metric, explain:\n    ◦ Why it matters / the business value (lean on the value props of PitCrew here to inform your writing)\n    ◦ How we will measure it plus why we recommend this methodology\n    ◦ The target goal\n• Let's place the total evaluation timeline, for each store, at minimum 60 days, starting from when PitCrew is first installed. 15 days of baseline collection then 45 days of comparison for improvement\n    ◦ We should also include a draft roll out schedule. Assume 10 total stores. They already have 2 deployed, so 8 new deployments. Let's assume 4 the first month and 4 the second month. Assume it takes 15 days to ship server, and do set up and configuration before we're ready to start collecting baseline. So each store is total of ~90 days. Given 4 stores won't be deployed til the second month, that means that this whole thing would run for about 120 days aka  months\n• In addition, one concern that the customer has voiced is that the roll out of the pilot stores took a lot of time/effort from one of their key people to support, so they're concerned about the maintenance burden of rolling out additional stores. As such, it's important that we mention this explicitly and how we plan to mitigate the burden on them. I'm not sure how we would measure this. Maybe we add another success criterion that's: by the 10th store, PitCrew installation can be performed entirely by the on-site crew with no on-site travel required from Kou (the key person mentioned) or from Leverege.\n    ◦ We should also cover the process for rolling out a new store. Basically we ship them a server, someone onsite plugs it into their NVR via ethernet, then once we access the local cameras we give feedback on adjustments to camera angles. They also physically install at least one TV in the bay in a place where everyone can see it.\nBefore you attempt, do you have any questions?

Aligning on these metrics now is the only way to ensure the data supports a 75-store rollout decision later.\n\nBefore I draft the full document, I have three clarifying questions to ensure the specific mechanics of the plan are airtight:\n\n### Questions\n1.  **The \"Blind\" Baseline:** For the *Average Service Duration* baseline (the first 2 weeks), should we explicitly state that the bay TVs will be **off/absent** and managers should **not** coach based on the data yet? To get a true scientific baseline, the staff shouldn't know they are being measured against a new standard yet (avoiding the Hawthorne Effect).\n2.  **CSAT Calculation:** When you say a \"1% improvement,\" do you mean a 1 percentage *point* increase (e.g., 65% to 66%) or a 1% relative increase (which would be 65% to 65.65%)? I assume you mean **percentage points** (65 to 66), as that is standard for CSAT, but I want to confirm.\n3.  **Installation Support:** Regarding the \"No travel for Kou\" metric—is it accurate to say that **remote** support from Leverege/PitCrew is still acceptable during this phase? I want to distinguish between \"no support needed\" (unrealistic) and \"no on-site hand-holding needed\" (the goal).\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Document Structure\n\nIf those assumptions look correct, here is how I propose structuring the **\"Ivy Lane Expansion Plan: 10-Store ROI Validation\"** document.\n\n**1.

The primary objective of this phase is to validate the **Return on Investment (ROI)** and operational scalability of the PitCrew platform to support a decision for a full fleet rollout (75 stores).\n\nThis document outlines the objective success metrics, the measurement methodology, and the rollout schedule designed to minimize operational burden on Ivy Lane leadership.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Key Success Metrics & Targets\n\nWe will evaluate the success of this expansion based on three core pillars: **Service Efficiency**, **Customer Sentiment**, and **Operational Scalability**.\n\n### Metric A: Average Service Duration (Throughput Efficiency)\n*   **The Business Value:** Reducing service duration directly impacts Unit Economics. Faster bay turnover increases revenue potential during peak demand (minimizing drive-offs) and reduces labor costs per invoice. It allows Ivy Lane to achieve higher throughput without adding physical bays or headcount.\n*   **Measurement Methodology:** **The \"Blind\" Baseline.**\n    *   Because historical data is not available for these specific stores, we will use PitCrew to generate the baseline.\n    *   **Phase 1 (Baseline):** For the first 15 days post-installation, PitCrew will run \"silently\" in the background. Data is collected, but in-bay TV dashboards are turned *off*. This establishes the \"Before\" state without influencing crew behavior.\n    *   **Phase 2 (Active):** We activate the in-bay TV dashboards and manager alerts. We then compare the average service duration of Phase 2 against the Phase 1 baseline.\n*   **Target Goal:** **10% Reduction** in Average Service Duration.\n    *   *Example: If the baseline average is 20 minutes, the target is a reduction to 18 minutes.*\n\n### Metric B: Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)\n*   **The Business Value:** Improved service speed and accurate wait times reduce customer anxiety and uncertainty. Higher satisfaction correlates with increased retention and Lifetime Value (LTV).\n*   **Measurement Methodology:** **Year-Over-Year (YoY) Comparison.**\n    *   To control for seasonality (e.g., summer road trip volume vs. winter lull), we will compare the CSAT scores from the expansion period against the exact same calendar dates from the previous year, utilizing Ivy Lane’s existing survey data.\n*   **Target Goal:** **+1 Point Increase** in overall Satisfaction Score.\n    *   *Example: If the YoY historical score was 65%, the target is 66%.*\n\n### Metric C: Deployment Scalability (Maintenance Burden)\n*   **The Business Value:** For a 75-store rollout to be viable, the installation process must be repeatable and low-touch for Ivy Lane leadership. We must prove that deployment does not require constant oversight from key personnel (specifically Kou).\n*   **Measurement Methodology:** **Remote-Only Installation.**\n    *   We will track the level of support required for the final stores in this expansion.\n*   **Target Goal:** **Zero On-Site Travel.**\n    *   By Store #10, the installation must be performed entirely by the on-site crew/local techs with remote support from PitCrew. No on-site travel required from Kou or Leverege staff.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Timeline & Rollout Schedule\n\nThe evaluation period for each store is designed to last approximately **90 days** from hardware shipment to the conclusion of data gathering. The total project timeline is estimated at **120 days (4 months)**.\n\n### The \"Per Store\" Lifecycle\n1.  **Days 1–15 (Setup):** Hardware shipment, server installation, camera configuration.\n2.  **Days 16–30 (Baseline):** \"Blind\" data collection (15 Days).\n3.  **Days 31–75 (Evaluation):** Active usage with dashboards (45 Days).\n4.  **Day 76+:** Review results.\n\n### Draft Rollout Schedule (8 New Stores)\nTo manage bandwidth, we will stagger the rollout into two batches.\n\n*   **Month 1: Batch A (4 Stores)**\n    *   *Focus:* Initial training and refining the remote-install process.\n    *   *Status:* Hardware ships Day 1. Baseline collection begins ~Day 15.\n*   **Month 2: Batch B (4 Stores)**\n    *   *Focus:* Testing full independence (Goal: Zero travel/intervention for Kou).\n    *   *Status:* Hardware ships Day 30. Baseline collection begins ~Day 45.\n\n**Project Conclusion:** All data collection for Batch B will conclude by the end of Month 4, allowing for a comprehensive ROI presentation immediately following.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Operational Implementation & Burden Mitigation\n\nWe recognize that the initial pilot placed a heavy support burden on Ivy Lane’s internal team (Kou). To mitigate this, PitCrew has streamlined the deployment process to be \"Plug-and-Play.\"\n\n**The Standardized Install Process (No Special Skills Required):**\n\n1.  **Server Shipment:** PitCrew ships a pre-configured server to the store.\n2.  **Connection:** On-site staff connects the server to the existing NVR (camera system) via a standard ethernet cable.\n3.  **Remote Configuration:** PitCrew remotely accesses the camera feed. We identify necessary camera angle adjustments and provide specific feedback (e.g., \"Tilt Camera 2 down 10 degrees\").\n4.  **TV Mount:** On-site staff mounts one TV monitor in the bay (visible to techs) and connects it to the network.\n\n**Our Commitment:**\nPitCrew will handle all remote configuration, software provisioning, and staff training via video calls. Ivy Lane leadership will only be required for high-level coordination, not on-site troubleshooting.\n\n_Source: Generated by Gemini 3 Pro_","resolved_entities":null,"confidence":null,"created_at":"2026-02-12T02:32:58.575Z","entry_point":"slack","test_run":false,"intent":"GENERAL_HELP","intent_detection_method":"llm","answer_contract":"GENERAL_RESPONSE","contract_selection_method":"default","context_layers":{"product_ssot":false,"slack_search":false,"multi_meeting":false,"total_time_ms":46402,"single_meeting":false,"lastResponseType":"general_knowledge","product_identity":true,"progress_message_count":0},"resolution":{"meeting_id":null,"company_source":"extracted","meeting_source":"none"},"evidence_sources":null,"llm_usage":{"purposes":["intent_classification"],"total_calls":1}},{"id":"07fef76a-f7aa-4fc4-804d-ea113c6e2418","slack_thread_id":"1770865965.817569","slack_message_ts":"1770865982.580259","slack_channel_id":"C0A80S3HJNL","user_id":"U082TV42FM0","company_id":null,"meeting_id":null,"capability_name":"GENERAL_RESPONSE","question_text":"One of our customers, Ivy Lane, is considering expansion beyond the 2 store pilot we did with them. They want to expand to 10 stores, and use this to more closely evaluate the ROI of PitCrew before deciding whether they deploy to the rest of their footprint (about 75 total stores). For this 10 store expansion, it'll be critical that we are aligned on which metrics we are evaluating, so that we can have an objective measure of success. I want to create a draft plan for expansion which includes (a) which key metrics we'll be evaluating, (b) how we'll measure/evaluate them, and (c) what % improvement we're targeting for each metric. I do not have confidence in the customer creating this themselves, so I believe we need to create a draft and have them react to it.\n\nCreate a document that details success measures for this 10 store expansion. Here is what I'm thinking:\n• One of the metrics is customer satisfaction. They already measure this via surveys that customers take. To measure this, we would compare the same calendar period from the year prior (to reduce extraneous variables like seasonality). Happier customers should lead to more business over time, i.e. more repeat customers, though we won't be able to prove that necessarily during this expansion\n    ◦ Let's target a 1% improvement (e.g. if their overall satisfaction score was 65%, we bump it to 66%)\n• The other metric is average service duration. This will ultimately translate into one or both of the following: (1) more revenue, because during periods of high demand more invoices can be completed with the same team meaning more money, and you lose fewer customers to abandonments from too long wait times, and (2) labor cost savings, because you can accomplish the same number of invoices with a smaller team\n    ◦ Measuring this is a bit more tricky, since Ivy Lane doesn't have any pre-existing data for comparison.

A few questions first, then my proposed structure.\n\n---\n\n## Questions Before I Draft\n\n1. **Customer Satisfaction — Metric Specifics:** Do you know what form their satisfaction score takes? (e.g., NPS, a 1–5 star rating, a percentage-based \"overall satisfaction\" score?) This matters for how precisely we frame the \"1% improvement\" target — a 1-point NPS lift is very different from a 1 percentage-point lift on a satisfaction %. I'll assume it's a percentage-based overall satisfaction score unless you tell me otherwise.\n\n2. **Average Service Duration — Scope:** Should this be total time vehicle-on-site (arrival to departure), or bay time only (vehicle enters bay to vehicle exits bay)? PitCrew can measure both, and the distinction matters for what levers we're claiming to pull. My instinct is bay-to-bay or arrival-to-departure is more meaningful to Ivy Lane's business, but pure bay time is cleaner for us to measure. What's your preference?\n\n3. **Existing 2 Pilot Stores:** Are those 2 stores included in the 10-store evaluation, or are they separate (i.e., 2 existing + 8 new = 10 total in the evaluation cohort)? Your wording suggests they're part of the 10. If so, do we already have baseline and performance data from those 2 that we can reference, or do we treat them differently in the measurement plan?\n\n4. **Rollout Burden — \"By the 10th store\" Target:** I like the idea of making this a success criterion. Do you want this framed as a binary pass/fail (the 10th store is installed without Kou traveling or Leverege traveling on-site), or something more graduated (e.g., Kou's involvement drops from X hours to Y hours per store over the course of the rollout)?\n\n5. **Audience & Tone:** Is this going directly to Ivy Lane's decision-maker(s) as a polished proposal, or is it an internal-facing draft that you'll adapt before sending? This affects tone and how much we \"sell\" vs. just \"align.\"\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Document Structure\n\nHere's how I'd organize it:\n\n> **Title: Ivy Lane × PitCrew — 10-Store Expansion: Success Criteria & Evaluation Plan**\n>\n> **1.

Success Metrics — Detailed Breakdown\n\n---\n\n### 2.1 Customer Satisfaction Score\n\n#### Why It Matters\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the leading indicator of retention and lifetime value. In service businesses, satisfaction is driven largely by two things customers feel acutely: **how long they waited** and **how well they were treated during that wait**. PitCrew directly impacts both — it reduces actual service time and, through real-time visibility, enables staff to set and meet accurate expectations, greet customers faster, and reduce the uncertainty that erodes trust.\n\nA satisfied customer comes back. Over time, even a modest improvement in satisfaction compounds into measurably higher repeat visit rates and revenue per location. While proving the downstream revenue impact within this evaluation window may not be feasible, improving the satisfaction score itself is a meaningful and measurable signal that PitCrew is creating a better customer experience.\n\n#### How We Will Measure It\n\nIvy Lane already collects customer satisfaction data via post-service surveys, reported as a **percentage-based overall satisfaction score**. This gives us a reliable, pre-existing data source with no additional instrumentation required.\n\n**Methodology:** For each of the 10 stores in the evaluation cohort, we will compare the overall satisfaction score during the active evaluation period against the **same calendar period from the prior year** at that same store.\n\n**Why this methodology:** Comparing the same calendar window year-over-year controls for seasonality, weather, and demand-cycle effects that could otherwise distort the comparison. Because Ivy Lane already has historical survey data, no new baseline collection is needed for this metric — we simply compare against last year's performance during the equivalent dates.\n\n#### Target\n\n> **+1 percentage point improvement** in overall customer satisfaction score, averaged across the 10-store cohort, compared to the same calendar period in the prior year.\n>\n> *Example: If the cohort averaged 65% satisfaction during that period last year, the target is 66% or higher.*\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Average Service Duration (Bay Time)\n\n#### Why It Matters\n\nBay time — the duration a vehicle spends actively being serviced in the bay — is the core operational lever for service businesses. Reducing bay time unlocks value in two ways:\n\n1. **More revenue during peak demand.** When bays turn faster, more vehicles can be serviced with the same team during high-demand windows. This means more completed invoices, fewer customers lost to long wait times or drive-offs, and better capture of the revenue that's already at your door.\n\n2. **Labor cost savings during steady-state demand.** When the same volume of work can be completed in less time, staffing can be right-sized — accomplishing the same number of invoices with fewer labor hours.\n\nPitCrew drives bay time improvement by giving managers and technicians real-time visibility into how long each vehicle has been in the bay, surfacing bottlenecks as they happen, and creating a performance-aware culture through bay-level dashboards. When teams can see where time is being lost, they naturally move faster and with more coordination.\n\n#### How We Will Measure It\n\nUnlike customer satisfaction, Ivy Lane does not have pre-existing historical data on bay time. PitCrew's vision AI will be the system of record for this metric. To create a fair comparison, we will use an **in-store baseline approach**:\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n- **Baseline Period (Days 1–15 after install):** PitCrew cameras are live and collecting bay time data, but **no dashboards are displayed** in the bays and **no manager access** is granted to PitCrew insights. This captures the store's natural operating performance without any PitCrew-driven behavior change.\n- **Active Period (Days 16–60 after install):** Bay TV dashboards are turned on, store managers are given access to PitCrew's real-time and historical data, and the team begins operating with full PitCrew visibility. Bay time data continues to be collected.\n- **Comparison:** Average bay time during the Active Period is compared against average bay time during the Baseline Period for each store.\n\n**Why this methodology:** Since no prior bay time data exists, a within-store baseline is the most practical and fair approach. The 15-day baseline window is long enough to capture a representative sample of normal operations across different days of the week and demand levels, while being short enough to keep the overall evaluation timeline efficient. Comparing each store against its own baseline also controls for store-level differences in layout, staffing, and customer mix.\n\n#### Target\n\n> **10% reduction** in average bay time, averaged across the 10-store cohort, comparing the Active Period against each store's Baseline Period.\n>\n> *Example: If a store's baseline average bay time is 20 minutes, the target is 18 minutes or less.*\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Rollout Scalability\n\n#### Why It Matters\n\nDuring the initial 2-store pilot, Ivy Lane's team — and Kou in particular — invested significant time and effort supporting on-site installation and configuration. That level of involvement was appropriate for a pilot, but it does not scale to 75 locations. If every new store requires Kou to travel on-site or Leverege to send a field team, the operational burden and cost of expansion become a barrier regardless of how strong the ROI is on the other metrics.\n\nFor PitCrew to be a viable platform across Ivy Lane's full footprint, the installation process must be **simple enough that on-site store staff can complete it independently**, with remote guidance from Leverege. This metric directly tests whether that's achievable.\n\n#### How We Will Measure It\n\nThis is a **binary pass/fail** criterion evaluated on the final store deployed in the cohort.\n\n**Methodology:** Across the 8 new store deployments, Leverege will progressively refine the remote installation process, documentation, and support workflow. By the 10th store (the last new deployment), we will evaluate:\n\n> **Can the PitCrew installation be completed entirely by on-site store personnel, with remote support from Leverege, and with zero on-site travel required from Kou or from Leverege?**\n\n**What \"installation\" includes:**\n1. Receiving the pre-configured server shipped by Leverege\n2. Plugging the server into the store's existing NVR via ethernet\n3. Leverege remotely accessing the local camera feeds and providing feedback on camera angle adjustments\n4. On-site staff adjusting camera angles per Leverege's guidance\n5. Physically mounting at least one TV dashboard in the service bay in a location visible to all technicians\n\nIf all five steps are completed without Kou or Leverege traveling to the store, this metric is a **pass**.\n\n#### Target\n\n> **Pass:** The 10th store in the cohort is fully installed with no on-site travel from Kou or Leverege.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evaluation Timeline & Rollout Schedule\n\n### 3.1 Per-Store Timeline\n\nEach store follows a ~90-day lifecycle from shipment to evaluation completion:\n\n| Phase | Duration | Description |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| **Ship & Setup** | ~15 days | Server shipped to store; on-site connection to NVR; Leverege remote configuration; camera angle adjustments; TV installation |\n| **Baseline Collection** | 15 days | PitCrew collecting bay time data silently — no dashboards or manager access |\n| **Active Evaluation** | 45 days | Dashboards live in bays, managers have access, full PitCrew experience enabled |\n| **Store Total** | **~75 days post-setup** / **~90 days from shipment** | |\n\n*Note: Customer satisfaction is evaluated on a calendar year-over-year basis and does not depend on the baseline/active phasing above.*\n\n### 3.2 Cohort Rollout Schedule\n\n| Wave | Stores | Timing |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| **Existing Pilot** | Stores 1–2 | Already deployed — enter Baseline or Active phase immediately* |\n| **Wave 1** | Stores 3–6 (4 new) | Ship in Month 1 |\n| **Wave 2** | Stores 7–10 (4 new) | Ship in Month 2 |\n\n*\\*For the 2 existing pilot stores, we will align their evaluation windows with the overall program timeline. If dashboards are already active, we will use the earliest available PitCrew data as baseline or apply the year-over-year comparison method for both metrics at these locations. Specific treatment to be agreed upon during kickoff.*\n\n### 3.3 Overall Program Timeline\n\n| Month | Activity |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Month 1** | Ship & set up Wave 1 (Stores 3–6); align existing pilot stores (1–2) to evaluation framework |\n| **Month 2** | Wave 1 enters Baseline → Active transition; Ship & set up Wave 2 (Stores 7–10) |\n| **Month 3** | Wave 1 in Active evaluation; Wave 2 enters Baseline → Active transition |\n| **Month 4** | Wave 2 completes Active evaluation; all 10 stores have full data; final analysis and readout |\n\n> **Total program duration: ~120 days (~4 months)** from first Wave 1 shipment to final evaluation readout.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Addressing Rollout Burden\n\nWe understand that the pilot installation process placed a significant time and coordination burden on Ivy Lane's team — particularly on Kou. Scaling to 75 stores under those conditions would not be sustainable, and we take that concern seriously.\n\nOur plan for this 10-store expansion is designed to **progressively reduce Ivy Lane's involvement per store** with the explicit goal of proving that the process can be fully self-service by the end of the cohort.\n\n### 4.1 Installation Process (Per Store)\n\n| Step | Who | Where |\n|------|-----|-------|\n| 1. Ship pre-configured server | Leverege | Remote |\n| 2. Plug server into NVR via ethernet | On-site store staff | On-site |\n| 3. Remote camera feed access & angle feedback | Leverege | Remote |\n| 4. Adjust camera angles per guidance | On-site store staff | On-site |\n| 5. Mount TV dashboard in bay | On-site store staff | On-site |\n\n### 4.2 How We'll Reduce Burden Over the 8 New Deployments\n\n- **Stores 3–6 (Wave 1):** Leverege will provide hands-on remote support and may request Kou's involvement for coordination. We will document every friction point, question, and issue encountered during these installs.\n- **Stores 7–9 (early Wave 2):** Leverege will use lessons from Wave 1 to deliver improved documentation, streamlined remote support, and clearer instructions to on-site staff. Kou's involvement should decrease significantly.\n- **Store 10 (final deployment):** This is the scalability test. On-site store staff complete the full installation with remote Leverege support only. No travel from Kou. No travel from Leverege. Pass/fail evaluation per Section 2.3.\n\nThis progression gives us 9 iterations to refine the process before the critical test, and gives Ivy Lane tangible evidence of whether PitCrew can scale across the remaining ~65 stores without creating an operational bottleneck.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of Success Criteria\n\n| Metric | Measurement Method | Target | Evaluation Window |\n|--------|--------------------|--------|-------------------|\n| **Customer Satisfaction Score** | Year-over-year comparison of survey-based overall satisfaction score (same calendar period) | +1 percentage point (cohort average) | Active Period vs. same dates prior year |\n| **Average Service Duration (Bay Time)** | PitCrew-measured bay time: Active Period vs. Baseline Period (per store) | −10% (cohort average) | 15-day baseline → 45-day active, per store |\n| **Rollout Scalability** | Binary evaluation of 10th store installation | Pass: no on-site travel from Kou or Leverege | 10th store deployment |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Next Steps\n\n1. **Ivy Lane to review** this success measurement plan and provide feedback on metrics, targets, and methodology\n2. **Align on the 8 new store locations** for Wave 1 and Wave 2\n3. **Confirm evaluation start date** and calendar period for year-over-year customer satisfaction comparison\n4. **Agree on treatment of existing 2 pilot stores** within the evaluation framework\n5. **Kick off Wave 1 shipments** upon mutual sign-off\n\n---\n\n*This document is a draft prepared by the PitCrew team for Ivy Lane's review. Targets and methodology are proposed based on our experience and are intended as a starting point for alignment — not a unilateral commitment. We welcome Ivy Lane's input to ensure these success criteria reflect what matters most to your business.*\n\n_Source: Generated by Claude Opus 4.6_","resolved_entities":null,"confidence":null,"created_at":"2026-02-12T03:19:01.431Z","entry_point":"slack","test_run":false,"intent":"GENERAL_HELP","intent_detection_method":"llm","answer_contract":"GENERAL_RESPONSE","contract_selection_method":"default","context_layers":{"product_ssot":false,"slack_search":false,"multi_meeting":false,"total_time_ms":85998,"single_meeting":false,"lastResponseType":"general_knowledge","product_identity":true,"progress_message_count":0},"resolution":{"meeting_id":null,"company_source":"extracted","meeting_source":"none"},"evidence_sources":null,"llm_usage":{"purposes":["intent_classification"],"total_calls":1}},{"id":"ee4a5b16-97e9-4f01-967b-122c64ad16e2","slack_thread_id":"1770860894.788439","slack_message_ts":"1770860964.841949","slack_channel_id":"C0A80S3HJNL","user_id":"U082TV42FM0","company_id":null,"meeting_id":null,"capability_name":"SLACK_MESSAGE_SEARCH","question_text":"can you link me to this conversation in slack?","answer_text":"**I can't provide a direct link to the specific conversation about Allied Lube, but here are some relevant messages related to it.**\n\n**Why This Answer:**\nThe user is asking for a link to a conversation, but the context of the discussion about Allied Lube is spread across multiple messages in the Slack channels.
