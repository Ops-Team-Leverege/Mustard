🚨 Critical Maintainability Issues Found
1. HARDCODED RULES EPIDEMIC
Most Critical Issues:

Progress Messages: 20-second delay and 4-message limit hardcoded
Document Generation: 300-word threshold and contract list in JSON config
Evidence Thresholds: Meeting count requirements (2, 3, 5) hardcoded per contract
LLM Model Selection: Model names scattered across 10+ files with no central registry
Confidence Thresholds: 0.85/0.70 action item confidence tiers hardcoded
Impact: Cannot optimize without redeployment; no A/B testing capability; locked into specific providers.

2. ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS
Control Plane Authority Violations (Most Serious):

// server/slack/events.ts lines 500-550 - VIOLATION
const syntheticControlPlane = {
  intent: mappedIntent as any,
  answerContract: storedProposedInterpretation.contract as any,
  // ... bypassing actual Control Plane
};
Intent Classification Leakage:

Control Plane classifies intent
BUT: 4 other files also make intent-like decisions
Result: Inconsistent behavior, hard to audit
Contract Selection Duplication:

Primary selection in answerContracts.ts
Duplicate logic in contractExecutor.ts and events.ts
Result: Maintenance nightmare
3. BRITTLE IMPLEMENTATIONS
String-Based Contract Matching:

// server/services/documentGenerator.ts - BRITTLE
const isInList = config.generateDocForContracts.includes(contract);
No enum validation, case-sensitive, silent failures.

Regex-Based Intent Classification:

50+ regex patterns with overlapping matches
No priority ordering or conflict detection
Example: "follow up" matches both SINGLE_MEETING and NEXT_STEPS
Evidence Detection Heuristics:

// BRITTLE: Counting question marks as evidence
case AnswerContract.CROSS_MEETING_QUESTIONS:
  evidenceCount = (output.match(/\?/g) || []).length;
4. CONFIGURATION FRAGMENTATION
Configuration scattered across:

progress.json
 - progress messages
documents.json
 - document generation
Environment variables - API keys
Hardcoded in code - thresholds, timeouts
Database - product SSOT
No single source of truth; no audit trail.
