Polish Commitment-Based Next Steps Extraction (Google-Level)

You are working in an existing TypeScript backend with a layered architecture.

Do NOT change architecture or flow.
This task is a polish pass on the existing commitment-based next steps extraction to match Google Meet–level quality.

Context (Already Implemented — Do Not Rebuild)

Commitment-based next steps extraction exists

Uses extractive LLM logic (not summarization)

Requires explicit verbal commitments

Assigns owners

Includes evidence quotes

Uses a confidence threshold to suppress false positives

This task only refines output quality and heuristics.

Goals

Improve the readability, actionability, and completeness of extracted next steps while preserving strict correctness.

Changes to Implement (Only These)
1️⃣ Clean Evidence Quotes (Dysfluency Removal)

Problem
Evidence quotes currently include speech artifacts such as:

“um”

“uh”

false starts

repeated words

This reduces readability compared to Google Meet.

Change
Update the commitment extraction prompt to include:

“When including the evidence quote, remove filler words such as ‘um’, ‘uh’, ‘like’, or repeated false starts, without changing the meaning or intent.”

Rules

Do NOT paraphrase

Do NOT summarize

Do NOT change intent

Only clean obvious filler words

2️⃣ Prefer People Over Organizations for Owners

Problem
Some next steps are assigned to organizations (e.g. “Leverege”) even when a specific person spoke.

Change
Bias owner assignment toward specific people when identifiable.

Add instruction to the prompt:

“When assigning an owner, prefer a specific person’s name over a company or team name if the speaker can be identified.”

Expected Outcome

“Send login information — Corey Redd”

not “Send login information — Leverege”

3️⃣ Two-Tier Confidence Threshold (Capture Soft Follow-Ups)

Problem
Some valid “investigation” or “follow-up” commitments (e.g. “We’ll look into that”) are missed because the confidence threshold is too strict.

Change
Implement two tiers:

confidence ≥ 0.8
→ Confirmed Next Steps

0.65 ≤ confidence < 0.8
→ Follow-Ups to Track

confidence < 0.65
→ omit entirely

Rules

Do NOT merge tiers

Do NOT lower standards for confirmed items

False positives remain worse than omissions

Output Structure (Slack-Friendly)

Example:

*Next Steps*
• Send login information to all attendees — Corey Redd (this afternoon)
  _“Everyone will be sent login information this afternoon…”_

*Follow-Ups to Track*
• Investigate DTIQ high-definition camera issue — Calum McClelland / Robert Colongo
  _“We’ll take a look and get back to you…”_

Out of Scope ❌

❌ No new extraction logic

❌ No vector search

❌ No persistence changes

❌ No Slack UX refactors

❌ No new intent detection

❌ No cross-meeting logic

Acceptance Criteria

After implementation:

Evidence quotes read cleanly

Owners are people, not companies, when possible

Soft but real follow-ups are captured separately

Output quality matches or exceeds Google Meet’s “Next Steps”

Architectural Principle (Do Not Violate)

We extract commitments; we do not infer intent.
Polish must not introduce hallucination.
