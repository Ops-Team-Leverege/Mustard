Solution Overview
Change the approach from:
User asks for summary → LLM summarizes raw transcript → Generic summary (loses details)
To:
User asks for summary → Query pre-extracted data from database → LLM formats/presents → Rich summary (preserves everything)
The LLM's role changes from analyst to formatter/presenter.

What Data to Query
When generating a meeting summary, PitCrew Sauce should retrieve these from the database:
1. From transcripts table:

main_meeting_takeaways - One-line meeting status
next_steps - Follow-up actions identified
leverage_team - Internal attendees (e.g., "Hannah White, Julia Conn, Eric Conn, Steven Lee, Ryan Chacon")
customer_names - Customer attendees (e.g., "Robert Moyer, Subin Babu Pallichadath Sankarankutty, Adam Walenga, J.J Santos")
company_name - Company name
meeting_date - When the meeting occurred

2. From product_insights table (all records for this transcript):

feature - What feature/capability was discussed
context - Why they want it, what problem it solves
quote - Verbatim customer quote (MUST be preserved exactly)
category_id - Can be resolved to category name if needed

3. From qa_pairs table (all records for this transcript):

question - The exact question asked
answer - The response given
asker - Who asked the question
category_id - Topic area

4. From meeting_action_items table (all records for this transcript):

action_text - What needs to be done
owner_name - Who is responsible
deadline - When it's due (may be null)
evidence_quote - Supporting quote from transcript
confidence - How confident the extraction is (0-1)


How the LLM Should Be Used
The LLM's job is now formatting and presentation only, not analysis.
Input to LLM:

The structured data retrieved from the database (all 4 queries above)
Instructions to format it for Slack

LLM Instructions Should Include:

DO NOT omit any Q&A pairs - include every single one
DO NOT paraphrase quotes - use them exactly as stored
DO NOT add information that isn't in the provided data
DO prioritize/highlight items related to: security, pricing, compliance, business continuity, deal blockers
DO group related items together logically

LLM Temperature:

Use low temperature (0.2-0.3) for consistent formatting
We want predictable presentation, not creative interpretation
