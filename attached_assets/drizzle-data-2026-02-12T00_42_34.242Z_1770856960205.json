This expansion is a critical step in evaluating the tangible return on investment (ROI) that PitCrew delivers before a potential full-footprint deployment across Ivy Lane's approximately 75 stores. To ensure an objective and data-driven assessment, this document outlines the key metrics we propose to evaluate, the methodologies for measurement, and the target improvements for each. This plan is designed to provide clear success criteria and a structured approach for the upcoming 10-store expansion.\n\n### Key Success Measures\n\n#### 1. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)\n\n*   **Why it Matters / Business Value:**\n    Customer satisfaction is a cornerstone of long-term business success, directly impacting customer retention and loyalty. PitCrew significantly contributes to an improved customer experience by providing real-time visibility into operations, which helps ensure every customer is greeted promptly, promise times are accurate, and overall wait times are reduced. When customers feel valued and their time is respected, repeat visits increase, and positive word-of-mouth enhances brand reputation. Happy customers are more likely to become loyal patrons, driving sustained business growth and strengthening Unit Economics & Capacity Planning by ensuring consistent demand.\n\n*   **How We Will Measure It:**\n    We will leverage Ivy Lane's existing customer survey data, which is already collected to measure customer satisfaction. Our methodology will involve comparing the average customer satisfaction scores from the ten PitCrew-enabled stores during the evaluation period against the scores from the *same calendar period in the previous year* (pre-PitCrew installation). We recommend this approach to minimize the impact of extraneous variables such as seasonality or broader market trends, providing a more accurate assessment of PitCrew's direct influence on customer sentiment.\n\n*   **Target Goal:**\n    We aim for a **1% improvement** in the overall customer satisfaction score. For example, if a store's average satisfaction score was 65%, our target would be an increase to 66%.\n\n#### 2. Average Service Duration\n\n*   **Why it Matters / Business Value:**\n    Average service duration is a critical indicator of operational efficiency and directly impacts both revenue potential and labor costs, aligning with PitCrew's value themes of Service Speed & Throughput Capacity and Unit Economics & Capacity Planning. A reduction in service duration translates into two primary benefits: (1) **Increased Revenue:** During periods of high demand, faster service allows more vehicles to be processed with the same team, capturing additional revenue and reducing customer abandonments due to long wait times. (2) **Labor Cost Savings:** The same volume of invoices can be completed with a smaller team, optimizing labor allocation and reducing operational expenses. PitCrew enables this by surfacing bottlenecks, speeding up intake processes, and ensuring work moves efficiently from bay to bay, maximizing throughput without requiring additional bays or headcount.\n\n*   **How We Will Measure It:**\n    Given that Ivy Lane may not have pre-existing granular data for direct historical comparison, our measurement methodology will establish a clear \"before and after\" within the same operational context. For each of the ten expansion stores, we will collect a **15-day baseline of average service duration** immediately following PitCrew installation but *before* the TV dashboards are activated and store managers are given full access to the system. Following this baseline period, we will activate the TV dashboards and provide manager access, then compare the average service duration from the subsequent **45 days** of active PitCrew utilization against the established baseline. This approach allows us to isolate the impact of PitCrew's real-time visibility and coaching tools.\n\n*   **Target Goal:**\n    We aim for a **10% improvement** in average service duration. For instance, if the initial average service duration is 20 minutes, our target is to reduce it by 2 minutes, bringing it down to 18 minutes.\n\n### Evaluation Timeline and Rollout Schedule\n\n#### Overall Evaluation Timeline\n\nFor each individual store, the evaluation timeline will span a minimum of **60 days** from the initial PitCrew installation. This period is broken down into:\n*   **15 days** for baseline data collection immediately post-installation.\n*   **45 days** for the comparison period, during which PitCrew's tools are actively used to drive improvement.\n\nConsidering the phased rollout across multiple stores, the entire project, from the first store's installation to the completion of the last store's 60-day evaluation, is anticipated to run for approximately **120 days (four months)**.\n\n#### Draft Rollout Schedule (8 New Stores)\n\nThe rollout for the 8 new stores will be phased to allow for focused support and smooth integration:\n\n*   **Deployment Process (Per Store):**\n    1.  **Server Shipment:** PitCrew will ship the necessary server hardware to the Ivy Lane store location.\n    2.  **On-site Setup:** The on-site store crew will plug the server into their existing Network Video Recorder (NVR) via Ethernet.\n    3.  **Remote Camera Configuration:** Once connected, Leverege will remotely access the local cameras and provide feedback to the on-site crew on any necessary adjustments to camera angles to ensure optimal data capture.\n    4.  **TV Dashboard Installation:** The on-site crew will physically install at least one TV dashboard in a visible location within the service bay area for real-time operational feedback.\n    5.  **Baseline Data Collection:** After camera angles are optimized and the TV is installed, a 15-day period for baseline data collection will commence.\n    6.  **Active PitCrew Use:** Following the baseline, TV dashboards will be activated and full manager access granted, initiating the 45-day improvement comparison period.\n\n*   **Phased Deployment Schedule:**\n    *   **Month 1:** Four new stores will begin their PitCrew deployment process. Allowing for approximately 15 days for shipping, setup, and configuration before baseline collection begins, these stores will then enter their 60-day evaluation period.\n    *   **Month 2:** The remaining four new stores will begin their PitCrew deployment process, following the same 15-day setup and 60-day evaluation cycle.\n\nThis staggered approach ensures that while individual store evaluations are 60 days, the full project duration extends to approximately 120 days to accommodate the sequential deployment and complete evaluation for all ten new locations.\n\n### Mitigating Deployment Burden and Streamlining Rollout\n\nIvy Lane has expressed a valid concern regarding the time and effort required from key personnel, such as Kou, during the initial pilot rollout. PitCrew is fully committed to addressing this by significantly streamlining the deployment process for this 10-store expansion, aiming to minimize the internal burden on Ivy Lane's team.\n\nOur strategy for mitigating this burden includes:\n*   **Standardized, Self-Service Installation:** The described rollout process (server shipment, on-site plug-in, remote camera adjustment guidance, on-site TV installation) is intentionally designed to be as self-sufficient as possible for the local store crew. We will provide comprehensive, clear instructions and dedicated remote support from Leverege throughout each step.\n*   **Reduced Need for On-Site Travel:** For this expansion, our primary objective is to dramatically reduce, and ideally eliminate, the necessity for on-site travel from either Leverege personnel or Ivy Lane's central team, including Kou. We believe that with our refined process and remote support capabilities, most, if not all, installation and configuration tasks can be managed effectively from a distance.\n*   **Success Criterion for Deployment Efficiency:** To objectively measure our success in reducing the deployment burden, we propose a specific criterion: **by the 10th store installation, PitCrew can be deployed and configured entirely by the on-site store crew with absolutely no on-site travel required from Kou or from Leverege personnel.** Achieving this will be a key indicator of our ability to scale PitCrew efficiently and cost-effectively across Ivy Lane's entire footprint in the future, demonstrating a truly streamlined and manageable rollout process.\n\n_Source: Generated by GPT-4o_","resolved_entities":null,"confidence":null,"created_at":"2026-02-11T16:22:03.087Z","entry_point":"slack","test_run":false,"intent":"GENERAL_HELP","intent_detection_method":"llm","answer_contract":"GENERAL_RESPONSE","contract_selection_method":"default","context_layers":{"product_ssot":false,"slack_search":false,"multi_meeting":false,"total_time_ms":23002,"single_meeting":false,"lastResponseType":"general_knowledge","product_identity":true,"progress_message_count":0},"resolution":{"meeting_id":null,"company_source":"extracted","meeting_source":"none"},"evidence_sources":null,"llm_usage":{"purposes":["intent_classification"],"total_calls":1}},{"id":"b0a2f480-3b58-4d41-a1ed-99f8c3a3094f","slack_thread_id":"1770833363.819989","slack_message_ts":"1770833845.353879","slack_channel_id":"D0AD7DZA01X","user_id":"U08S3B6BMD2","company_id":null,"meeting_id":null,"capability_name":"GENERAL_RESPONSE","question_text":"<@U082TV42FM0> are you able to see this if i tag you?","answer_text":"Yes, I am able to process your message when you include a tag like that.

Once validation is complete, a server will be shipped to the pilot store, and access to the system will be set up for key personnel like the owner and VP of operations. A kickoff meeting will then be scheduled to officially start the 60-day free pilot.\n\n_Corey will follow up with you and we can get working with you on identifying the right pilot store and doing some validation... Once we feel good about all that stuff, we'll ship you a server and kick things off._\n\n_Source: PitCrew Meeting Transcripts (synthesized by Gemini 2.5 Flash)_","resolved_entities":null,"confidence":null,"created_at":"2026-02-11T18:09:55.607Z","entry_point":"slack","test_run":false,"intent":"content","intent_detection_method":"default","answer_contract":"GENERAL_RESPONSE","contract_selection_method":"default","context_layers":{"product_ssot":false,"slack_search":false,"multi_meeting":false,"total_time_ms":23616,"single_meeting":false,"lastResponseType":"semantic","product_identity":true,"progress_message_count":0},"resolution":{"company_id":"dbb806f5-c83a-49b7-9182-f506b86826af","meeting_id":"b0ea5d86-c7e5-44c9-af1e-f6456c3b8aa6","company_source":"extracted","meeting_source":"last_meeting"},"evidence_sources":null,"llm_usage":{"purposes":["semantic_answer"],"total_calls":1}},{"id":"d4241b84-234b-42e4-b707-eaa8533a34c9","slack_thread_id":"1770833363.819989","slack_message_ts":"1770833442.064529","slack_channel_id":"D0AD7DZA01X","user_id":"U08S3B6BMD2","company_id":null,"meeting_id":null,"capability_name":"SLACK_MESSAGE_SEARCH","question_text":"can you link me to this conversation in slack","answer_text":"**Direct Answer:**  \n**Here are the links to the relevant conversations in Slack:**\n\n1. **Discussion on setting up a call**: [Link](https://leverege.slack.com/archives/C08GT0T2YRH/p1769783825522799?thread_ts=1769783825.522799) (Message by Ryan on Jan 30, 2026)\n   \n2. **Meeting with ACE regarding BI tools**: [Link](https://leverege.slack.com/archives/C08GT0T2YRH/p1768493547835659?thread_ts=1768493547.835659) (Message by Calum on Jan 15, 2026)\n   \n3. **Follow-up call with Costco**: [Link](https://leverege.slack.com/archives/C08GT0T2YRH/p1770677337477229?thread_ts=1770677337.477229) (Message by Julia on Feb 9, 2026)\n\n**Why This Answer:**  \nThese links provide direct access to discussions that may contain the information you are looking for.
