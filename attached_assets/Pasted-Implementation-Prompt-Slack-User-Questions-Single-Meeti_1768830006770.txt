Implementation Prompt
Slack User Questions — Single Meeting (Intent-Safe, Deterministic)
Context

We are updating how the Slack bot answers user questions about a single meeting, inside a Slack thread.

Important distinctions:

These are user questions asked after the meeting

They are not customer questions asked during the meeting

Each Slack thread represents exactly one meeting

We already have:

Thread ID → meeting resolution

Structured extractions (attendees, customer_questions, next steps / commitments)

Context-anchored, high-trust data

Existing summary generation

The remaining work is intent-safe routing and response behavior.

Scope (IMPORTANT)

This task applies only to:

Slack user questions scoped to a single meeting

Do not:

Change ingestion logic

Change extraction pipelines

Change OpenAI model usage elsewhere in the system

Modify cross-meeting, search, or analytics capabilities

Core Invariants (Must Hold)

One thread = one meeting

Summaries are opt-in only (never a fallback)

No inference or hallucination

Uncertainty must be communicated honestly

Only Tier-1 capabilities are allowed for single-meeting answers

Capability Trust Matrix (Authoritative)
Tier 1 — Allowed (Single-Meeting, High Trust)

Meeting attendees (getMeetingAttendees)

Customer questions (customer_questions)

Next steps / commitments (explicit extraction)

Raw transcript (extractive checks only)

Tier 2 — Summary Only (Explicit Opt-In)

meeting_summaries

GPT-5

Narrative only

Never used as fallback

Tier 3 — Not Allowed

Must NOT be used in this flow:

qa_pairs

searchQuestions

searchCompanyFeedback

getCompanyInsights

countCompaniesByTopic

getCompanyOverview

Any cross-meeting or analytics capability

Intent Classification (Required)

When a user asks a question in a Slack thread, classify it into one of three intents:

1️⃣ Extractive (Specific Fact)

Examples:

“What issue did Brian experience?”

“Who attended the meeting?”

“Was pricing discussed?”

Behavior

Query Tier-1 sources only

If evidence exists → answer with evidence

If not found → respond with softened uncertainty (see below)

Not allowed

No inference

No summarization

2️⃣ Aggregative (General but Directed)

Examples:

“What issues came up?”

“What concerns did the customer raise?”

“What open questions are there?”

Behavior

Return a curated list of extracted items

Each item must be grounded in Tier-1 data

No narrative summary

If nothing relevant is found → softened uncertainty

3️⃣ Summary (Explicit Only)

Examples:

“Summarize the meeting”

“Give me a meeting overview”

“What were the key takeaways?”

Behavior

Generate a meeting summary

Use existing summary implementation (GPT-5)

This path must be entered only when explicitly requested

Uncertainty Response (Standardized)

When no extractive or aggregative answer is found, respond with exactly this pattern (or equivalent wording):

“I don’t see this explicitly mentioned in the meeting.
If you’d like, I can share what was discussed instead.”

Rules:

Do not generate a summary automatically

Wait for explicit user follow-up before summarizing

Slack Behavior Rules (Reminder)

Bot responds only when explicitly tagged

Bot replies in-thread only

No proactive responses

No cross-thread or cross-meeting context

Acceptance Criteria

This task is complete when:

Specific questions never return summaries

General questions return lists, not narratives

Missing answers return softened uncertainty

Summaries are generated only after explicit user intent

GPT-5 is used only for summaries

Only Tier-1 capabilities are used for single-meeting answers

Final Note

This is a behavioral contract, not just an implementation detail.
Correctness, trust, and predictability matter more than “helpful-sounding” responses.
