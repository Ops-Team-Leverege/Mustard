Extractive Q&A from a Single Meeting

You are working in an existing TypeScript backend with a layered architecture:

Ingestion → deterministic transcript chunking

Retriever → fetches the last meeting deterministically

Composer → LLM-based interpretation

MCP → capability routing

Slack → presentation only

This task introduces extractive Q&A for meeting details, comparable in quality to Google Meet’s post-meeting Q&A.

Problem

Users are unlikely to ask:

“What was the last meeting about?”

They are much more likely to ask specific, semantic questions, such as:

“How many cameras did they say they have?”

“Where did they want to start the pilot?”

“How many stores does the customer operate?”

“What metrics did they care most about?”

“What did they say about data accuracy?”

These answers already exist in the transcript, but are buried in long discussions.

We need a grounded, extractive Q&A flow that:

Answers only from the meeting content

Does not hallucinate

Explicitly says when something was not mentioned

Goal

Add a single-meeting extractive Q&A path that:

Uses the full transcript of the last meeting

Extracts answers only if supported by the transcript

Returns:

a concise answer

a short supporting quote or reference

Matches the behavior users expect from Google Meet summaries

This is not RAG (no vector search yet).

In Scope ✅
1️⃣ Add an extractive Q&A composer function

Location:

server/rag/composer.ts

Add a function, for example:

answerMeetingQuestion(
  chunks: TranscriptChunk[],
  question: string
): {
  answer: string;
  evidence?: string;
}


Behavior:

Treat the transcript as the single source of truth

Do not invent information

If the answer is not clearly present, return:

“This wasn’t mentioned in the meeting.”

2️⃣ Use a strict extractive prompt (low hallucination)

The LLM prompt must:

Emphasize grounded extraction

Penalize guessing

Prefer exact quantities, locations, decisions

Prompt intent (not exact text):

You are answering questions about a meeting transcript.

Only answer if the transcript explicitly supports it.

If not mentioned, say so clearly.

Prefer factual answers over summaries.

3️⃣ Wire this into getLastMeeting.ts

Logic:

If the user asks a specific question (not “summary”):

Skip the summary composer

Call answerMeetingQuestion

Return:

Answer

Optional short supporting quote

No quotes section unless explicitly requested

Do not change:

MCP routing

Slack transport

Ingestion

4️⃣ No vector search (important)

This task must:

Use the already-retrieved meeting transcript

Not introduce embeddings

Not add a retriever step

Reason:
We already know which meeting we are answering about.

Out of Scope ❌

❌ No cross-meeting Q&A

❌ No vector databases

❌ No “best guess” answers

❌ No summarization reuse

❌ No changes to existing summary output

❌ No next-steps extraction (separate task)

Acceptance Criteria

After implementation:

Questions like:

“How many stores did they mention?”
return a grounded answer or “not mentioned”

Answers feel Google-like:

factual

concise

supported

No hallucinated numbers or decisions

Architecture remains clean and incremental

Architectural Principle (do not violate)

This is extraction, not reasoning across documents.

One meeting

One context

One answer

RAG will come later.
