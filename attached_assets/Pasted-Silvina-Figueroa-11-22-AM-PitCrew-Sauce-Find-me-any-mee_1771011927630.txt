Happy to help, @Silvina Figueroa...
[11:22 AM]A discussion about camera placement occurred on December 9, 2025. Chris Corwin mentioned the difficulty of moving a hardwired camera at store 42 and explored options for adjusting its vertical angle.
"I don't know if I'm going to be able to move 42, that final camera. Um at least in the initial phase, just because that one it's hardwired at that point." — Chris Corwin

[11:25 AM]For Discount Tire & Service Center, camera placement is currently being fine-tuned before customer access. 

Why This Answer:
Discount Tire & Service Center (DTSC) is in the process of finalizing their camera placement as part of the preparation for customer access. This indicates that the camera setup is a critical component of their pilot phase, ensuring that the system is optimized before being fully operational for customers.

Key Details:
- As of February 13, 2026, the camera models and placements are still being adjusted to meet the specific needs of DTSC before they allow customer access. This suggests a focus on ensuring that the system is fully functional and tailored to their operational requirements before going live. [Message 1 from #pitcrew_announcements by corey.redd on Feb 13, 2026]
- There have been discussions about camera angles affecting the visibility of certain bays at DTSC, which could impact the accuracy of service tracking. Adjustments are being made to optimize the views and ensure that all bays are adequately covered. [Message 12 from #pitcrew_collaboration by corey.chang on Feb 13, 2026]

General Context:
Camera placement is a crucial aspect of the PitCrew system, as it directly affects the accuracy of service tracking and analytics. Ensuring optimal camera angles and positions is a common challenge across various service centers, but specific adjustments are often required based on the unique layout and operational needs of each site.
