The issue is likely:

result.dataSource is "transcript" (not "artifacts")

This means hasArtifacts = false (because dataSource !== "not_found" but it's "transcript")
So the system thinks there are no artifacts
Returns transcript search results instead
Or the artifacts fetch is failing

Action items exist in DB but aren't being retrieved
Falls back to transcript search
Returns raw transcript chunks
The Logic Flaw
const hasArtifacts = result.dataSource !== "not_found";
This is too broad. It should be:

const hasArtifacts = result.dataSource === "artifacts" || result.dataSource === "action_items";
Because dataSource can be:

"artifacts" - found structured data
"transcript" - fell back to transcript search
"not_found" - nothing found
"semantic" - used LLM
Currently, the code treats "transcript" as "has artifacts" which is wrong.

What Needs to be Fixed
Without seeing the full code, the likely issues are:

Fix hasArtifacts check:

// WRONG:
const hasArtifacts = result.dataSource !== "not_found";

// RIGHT:
const hasArtifacts = result.dataSource === "artifacts" || 
                     result.dataSource === "action_items" ||
                     result.dataSource === "customer_questions";
Or check why artifacts aren't being found:

Are action items actually in the database for this meeting?
Is the query failing silently?
Is there a timing issue?
Or the extractive handler is returning wrong dataSource:

When it finds action items, it should return dataSource: "artifacts"
Not dataSource: "transcript"
Evidence
The screenshot shows the system is returning transcript search results with:

"In this meeting (Jan 30, 2026), the transcript mentions:"
Raw quotes from transcript
Not the structured action items format
This confirms the system is using transcript fallback instead of structured artifacts.

Recommendation
Check the handleExtractiveIntent function to see:

What dataSource value it returns when action items are found
Why it's falling back to transcript search
Fix the hasArtifacts check to properly distinguish between artifacts and transcript
The contract-aware logic is correct in principle, but the hasArtifacts check is too permissive.
