This way, you can quickly identify issues with cameras going offline or tasks failing and receive alerts to address them swiftly.\n\n2. **Automated Alerts and Notifications**:\n   - Utilize SMS and email notifications feature for real-time updates. Set up alerts for any camera or system component failures, ensuring immediate action can be taken before it impacts operations.\n\n3. **Data Consistency and Quality Checks**:\n   - Regularly perform checks on the data being fed into the system to ensure consistency and reliability. This includes checking for anomalies in video feeds or discrepancies in captured data.\n\n4. **Model Performance Evaluation**:\n   - Implement periodic evaluations of the AI models' performance across different locations. This involves assessing model outcomes and accuracy in identifying vehicle analytics, ensuring they perform optimally in diverse environmental and operational conditions.\n\n5. **Redundancy and Backup Systems**:\n   - Consider setting up redundant systems or backup cameras in crucial operational areas. This ensures that if one camera or system component fails, another can seamlessly take over, minimizing any potential downtime or data loss.\n\n6. **Continual Training & Updates**:\n   - Keep the AI models and systems updated with the latest software revisions and enhancements. This practice helps maintain the system’s effectiveness and adaptivity to changing vehicle models or new types of automotive services.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**:\n   - Maintain a feedback system where operators and managers can easily report any perceived inconsistencies or issues with the system. Use these insights to continually improve the system’s performance and reliability.\n\nThese strategies can help ensure that PitCrew's monitoring and analytical capabilities are robust, reliable, and provide consistent value across all locations. If you need a customized solution or further assistance, collaboration with the product and technical team would be beneficial to address specific technical challenges or deployment concerns.","resolved_entities":null,"confidence":null,"created_at":"2026-02-04T15:28:31.456Z","entry_point":"slack","test_run":false,"intent":"PRODUCT_KNOWLEDGE","intent_detection_method":"llm","answer_contract":"FAQ_ANSWER","contract_selection_method":"llm_proposed","context_layers":{"product_ssot":true,"multi_meeting":false,"total_time_ms":20521,"single_meeting":false,"document_context":false,"lastResponseType":"product_ssot","product_identity":true,"progress_message_count":0},"resolution":{"meeting_id":null,"company_source":"extracted","meeting_source":"none"},"evidence_sources":[{"type":"pitcrew_airtable_features"},{"type":"pitcrew_airtable_value_propositions"},{"type":"pitcrew_airtable_value_themes"},{"type":"pitcrew_airtable_feature_themes"},{"type":"pitcrew_airtable_customer_segments"}],"llm_usage":{"purposes":["intent_classification"],"total_calls":1}},{"id":"1b4563c3-2c07-432d-a56c-2403ab6548da","slack_thread_id":"1770218470.619969","slack_message_ts":"1770218554.886249","slack_channel_id":"D0ACHFYHEAK","user_id":"U05DZFEL9BK","company_id":"dbb806f5-c83a-49b7-9182-f506b86826af","meeting_id":"b0ea5d86-c7e5-44c9-af1e-f6456c3b8aa6","capability_name":"GENERAL_RESPONSE","question_text":"what was last call with jiffy about","answer_text":"*Meeting Summary (Allied Lube (Jiffy Lube))*\n\n*Purpose*\n• Align on scope, success criteria, and logistics for a 60‑day free pilot of Pit Crew (AI video analytics) and address camera/VMS access questions.\n\n*Key Topics*\n• Pilot plan: 4 phases (install/tuning; ~15‑day data baseline; days 15–60 live use with TV dashboards; final accuracy/impact report).  \n• Technical setup: connect to existing NVR/DVR/VMS (incl.
