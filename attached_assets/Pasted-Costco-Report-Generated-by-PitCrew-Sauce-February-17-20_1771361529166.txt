── PART 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ──
*Meeting: Costco — Feb 10, 2026*
*Status:* Meeting went well — Robert brought on his IT team so they could ask any
questions they feel are important. They are going to discuss internally and get back to us
within a few weeks.
*Our Team:* Hannah White, Julia Conn, Eric Conn, Steven Lee, Ryan Chacon
*Customer Attendees:* Robert Moyer, Subin Babu Pallichadath Sankarankutty, Adam
Walenga, J.J Santos
*Deal-Critical Items:*
● Security/Privacy & Video/Overnight Security — We highlighted person-blur for PII
protection and forthcoming video playback bundled with overnight security.
_"this store has decided to turn on person blur, which is something you can use if you want
to kind of protect the PII."_ — Hannah White
_"We are going to have video playback of each individual service too as one of the options
you can use in the features. And that'll come with overnight security as well."_ — Hannah
White
● Competitive Alternative (In-House Vendor) — Costco is evaluating us alongside
another internal group that has done similar work elsewhere at Costco.
_"there's another in-house company that has done similar work um for other parts of
Costco."_ — Robert Moyer
_"I'm asking Adam, JJ, and Suben to take a look at both."_ — Robert Moyer
● IT Involvement is Mandatory — Robert emphasized IT engagement for any path
forward.
_"anything we do is going to need it involved."_ — Robert Moyer
● Hard Requirement/Gap: Equipment-Level Utilization — Customer asked about “dead
time” by equipment; we can support by bay today and are open to R&D for
equipment-level beyond jack/lift.
_"And Hen, I'm assuming we could add to the dashboard um dead time by bay, dead
bedtime piece of equipment, too, if we really wanted to, right?"_ — Robert Moyer
_"We currently aren't doing uh equipment level utilization beyond maybe the jack and the lift
but if there is equipment you're interested in we do work with our customers throughout the
pilot to add more things to our roadmap..."_ — Hannah White
● Ongoing Partnership vs. Handoff — Customer probed whether this is a one-time
deployment or ongoing managed engagement; we confirmed continuous,
collaborative engagement through pilot and lifecycle.
_"with your current customers, is this just a development and then you hand it off or are you
live and part of the ongoing um management of the system?"_ — Robert Moyer
_"it's a product, so we'll we typically work really closely with our customers during the pilot
[...] We like to check in frequently, like to learn from y'all what you might want next"_ —
Hannah White
*Buying Signals:*

in at the right time. So that's why I invited them today."_ — Robert Moyer
● Requested to jump straight to the dashboard: _"can you start with the dashboard?"_
— Robert Moyer
● Asked detailed capability question: _"dead time by bay, dead bedtime piece of
equipment, too... right?"_ — Robert Moyer

*Competitive Context:*
● Internal alternative under evaluation: _"there's another in-house company that has
done similar work um for other parts of Costco."_ — Robert Moyer
● Incomplete/ambiguous mention likely referencing an external tire retailer: _"Now,
assuming that we didn't know this was less shaw because we saw their mats in the
sales area,"_ — Robert Moyer

duration, labor info.

[...] they're sitting there idle, no active labor."_ — Hannah White
