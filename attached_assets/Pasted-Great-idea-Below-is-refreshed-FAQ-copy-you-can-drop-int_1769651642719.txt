Great idea. Below is refreshed FAQ copy you can drop into the site. I’ve prioritized value-
forward questions first, then covered deployment, privacy/security, integrations, and
roadmap. For anything not clearly covered by the product SSOT, I’ve used safe phrasing
and flagged where you should verify with product/legal.
Customer outcomes and value
● How does PitCrew help us complete more services without adding bays or
headcount?
PitCrew gives real-time visibility into service start/stop times, idle time, and bottlenecks. Live
TV dashboards and configurable alerts keep work moving bay-to-bay so you increase
throughput and capture more revenue during peak demand.
● How does PitCrew help store managers improve performance?
Managers get live TV dashboards to spot issues in real-time, daily and weekly reports to
review trends with the team, and delay cause logging to address recurring bottlenecks.
These feedback loops support coaching, accountability, and a healthy performance culture.
● How does PitCrew improve staffing decisions and labor standards?
PitCrew provides execution-level data on service duration and labor minutes to inform more
accurate labor standards and smarter staffing. Historical trends help you project demand and
set targets by store, bay, and day.
● How does PitCrew improve the customer experience?
By reducing delays, monitoring intake and queues, and providing more accurate timing,
PitCrew lowers uncertainty and wait times so customers are greeted promptly and kept on
track throughout their visit.
● How does PitCrew support safety, security, and loss prevention?
PitCrew helps proactively detect and document safety and security issues, reduces costly
incidents, and simplifies investigations with objective event data and retention. (Automatic
identification of specific safety violations is on the roadmap; see “What’s coming next?”
below.)
Data and insights
● What data does PitCrew capture for each visit?
PitCrew captures vehicle service start and end times, license plate, make/model/color/body
type, labor minutes, and delay reasons. It also provides queue and foot traffic analytics for
broader visibility across intake and waiting areas.
● Can we stream PitCrew data into our data lake?
Yes. A real-time event data feed provides PitCrew events programmatically so you can
ingest them as they happen.
Integrations and compatibility
● Does PitCrew integrate with our POS?
PitCrew provides POS integration to enrich PitCrew with service data and to auto-populate
your POS with items such as VIN and license plate. For specific POS systems and
implementation details, please check the product documentation or speak with our team.
● Do you support SSO and role-based access?
Yes. PitCrew supports SSO integration and granular access controls by role and
organizational scope (store, district, region, corporate).
● Can PitCrew use our existing cameras?
Yes. PitCrew can use your existing cameras for a faster rollout (where compatible). We’ll
confirm compatibility during scoping.
● What if we don’t have cameras installed yet?
If you don’t currently have cameras, we’ll work with you to determine an approach that fits
your environment. Installation options and responsibilities vary by customer—please verify
the details and division of work with our team.
Alerts, dashboards, and devices
● Do you provide real-time alerts?
Yes. PitCrew supports SMS and email notifications and service idle alerts with configurable
thresholds.
● Do technicians and managers get live visibility?
Yes. Live TV dashboards display real-time performance and optional gamification elements,
and PitCrew is available on mobile and tablet for access while on the move.
Configuration and operations
● Can we set different targets or hours by store?
Yes. You can configure service targets per bay and per day, and set store-specific operating
hours so metrics, reports, and notifications align with local schedules.
Security, privacy, and governance
● How is PitCrew deployed and secured?
PitCrew is delivered as a single-tenant deployment for maximum separation, control, and
performance. Enterprise support and SLAs provide uptime and response commitments at
scale, and SSO plus granular access controls reinforce security.
● How do you protect customer and employee privacy?
PitCrew includes privacy controls with automatic blurring of people captured in footage to
preserve privacy. Configuration options are available to meet your policies.
● How long do you retain data?
PitCrew provides historical data retention for compliance, auditing, and coaching. Specific
retention policies are set per customer—please refer to your agreement.
● Who owns the data? Do you sell data to third parties?
Data ownership and permitted uses are governed by your contract. Please consult your
agreement or contact us for specifics. (If you want to keep the “you own your data / we don’t
sell” message from the current site, run the exact wording through legal for approval.)
Pricing
● How is PitCrew priced?
Please contact our sales team for the current pricing model and packaging. (If you plan to
disclose the pricing model publicly, insert the approved, SSOT-backed pricing model text
here.)

Notes on compliance and accuracy
● All items above marked as “roadmap” should include an availability disclaimer or
timeline only if approved by product.
● Avoid specific retention durations, camera installation promises, or legal/data
ownership assertions without confirmation.
● For integrations with specific vendors and any pricing language, route to
product/sales for approval.
If you share your brand voice guidelines (e.g., tone and length per FAQ), I can tighten these
answers to match the exact style of the page and trim to fit the component layout.
