It can also cover queue greeting adherence and AI-enabled security—so value is not solely throughput-based.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Have employees pushed back on being continuously monitored and tracked?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Generally no. By default there’s no facial identification; the system tracks movement counts and journeys. Large bay displays show only analytics (no video), and we can blur faces/bodies if privacy is a concern.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"If needed, can the system track specific individuals?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes, individual tracking is possible, though the default approach is privacy-first unless a customer requires otherwise.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Can the solution optimize staffing and scheduling per location based on appointments and walk-ins?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes, with integration to your scheduling system and sufficient historical data to learn patterns. We offer similar queue analytics elsewhere and would provide recommendations once accuracy is validated.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Is the only input camera feeds, and is that all you need to run the system?\",\n    \"answer\": \"We use your existing PoE cameras and deploy a small on-site edge server that connects to your switch. Models are trained in the cloud and run on the edge; events and stats are sent back.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Do you integrate with other applications beyond camera inputs?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes. We can integrate cloud-to-cloud or locally via the edge server; the architecture is flexible based on your environment.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Does the edge server have its own hotspot, or do you rely on the store network?\",\n    \"answer\": \"We rely on the store network, typically placing the device in a DMZ or isolated subnet. Deployment is simple and we can troubleshoot remotely.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"What actionable insights can managers use live, and what gets served up for end-of-week review?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Managers can see which crews/bays are fast or slow on mobile or large screens, intervene or coach, and use streaks (greens/reds) to spot issues or celebrate performance. The system flags process compliance (e.g., hood up within 2 minutes) and safety issues (e.g., oil spills, missing mats). Upper management can verify that brand processes are followed. AI can suggest actions, but humans retain override.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Do you support planogram-facing analytics like dwell time, interactions/touching products, and wayfinding?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes—we piloted this with PetSmart using fixed ceiling cameras to monitor shelves for low inventory/shelf holes and to analyze traffic flows (e.g., grooming vs. daycare). It’s technically feasible, but they didn’t scale due to ROI concerns (costs of extra cameras and an edge server vs. expected value).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"What does a typical pilot look like, and can we use existing cameras?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Pilots are typically 60 days, no-cost/obligation. We provide a small edge server, prefer locations with existing cameras, and do a site visit. We meet weekly to review data, iterate on needs, and ensure clear ROI before scaling.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Can you host our data in Canada to meet privacy requirements?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes. We can deploy the cloud instance in Canada; the platform is multi-tenant and supports multi-territory hosting, and we already host in other countries for international customers.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Are target times set per bay, and can they be set per service type to avoid false alerts given job variability?\",\n    \"answer\": \"During the pilot, targets are typically set per bay. Post-pilot, the best approach is a POS integration to match the current service and set targets by service type.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"How is the data captured—purely via AI/computer vision or manual input?\",\n    \"answer\": \"It’s fully automated via existing or newly installed cameras. Video streams to an edge server and then the cloud where models detect vehicle presence, type, and number of workers; no manual entry is needed beyond initial setup and feature toggles.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Can we gray out or disable bays when there’s no technician available?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes. You can set a timer to automatically mark a bay idle after a period or do it manually. It will automatically become active again when a car pulls in.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"How did you capture the pre-Pit Crew baseline data for comparison?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Pit Crew was installed and running for months, but store staff didn’t have access at first. The executive team monitored data to establish a baseline before granting store access for comparison.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"What training and involvement are required from store managers during the pilot?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Minimal is required—just turning on a TV dashboard can drive performance. Recommended: engage the store manager on calls for feedback and a walkthrough of daily/weekly reports; no heavy formal training needed.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Will the gamification effect wear off after 12 months?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Customers running it for years continue to improve. Even if gamification novelty tapers, the ongoing real-time feedback and bottleneck identification sustain and increase performance over time.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"How quickly can phase one of the pilot start after we decide to move forward?\",\n    \"answer\": \"The longest step is accessing cameras and shipping/connecting the server. It can be as fast as a couple of weeks, but timing depends on each store’s camera setup and inventory.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Do pilot stores need to have the same camera system?\",\n    \"answer\": \"It’s helpful but not required. The system integrates with different camera setups, and current customers typically use varied camera systems.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Is one store enough to prove value, and what should be true about that store?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes, one store can show benefits. Ideally include both a high- and low-performing store for comparison to better understand impact across different performance levels.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"What are the biggest challenges to getting started with a pilot (e.g., cameras/resolution, networking, data)?\",\n    \"answer\": \"Top items are camera access/coverage and ensuring all internal stakeholders (HR, ops, security, compliance) are engaged. We can do an optional site survey (at no cost) to review environment, camera coverage, and IT setup, which helps clear barriers quickly.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"For the pilot, can you host in a Canadian region, or will it be in the US?\",\n    \"answer\": \"We’d set you up as a single-tenant in a Canadian GCP region. We’re flexible and aim to host as close to your location as possible.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Post-pilot, how do you connect to our POS—do you use an open API?\",\n    \"answer\": \"It depends on the POS.
