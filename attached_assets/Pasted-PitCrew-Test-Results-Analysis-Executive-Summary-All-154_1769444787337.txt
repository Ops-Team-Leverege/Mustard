PitCrew Test Results Analysis
Executive Summary
All 154 tests "PASSED" but the bot is NOT working correctly!
The tests passed because they only checked:

HTTP 200 response ✓
Response time within threshold ✓

But they did NOT validate that the bot actually:

Used meeting data when it should have
Routed to the correct intent
Returned accurate, grounded answers

The Real Problem: Routing Failures
Statistics from Interaction Logs

Note: DOCUMENT_SEARCH intent is not yet implemented (pending Vertex AI integration), so those test failures are expected.

What This Means
86% of questions were classified as GENERAL_HELP and only received Ambient Context (PitCrew voice) instead of Evidence Context (actual meeting transcripts)!
The Intent → Context Layers → Answer Contract flow is broken at the Intent Classification step.
